The research found that over 1 in 5 patients hospitalized with Covid-19, and over 1 in 10 who were not hospitalized, were diagnosed with high blood pressure six months later. Compared to those with influenza, Covid-19 patients were more than twice as likely to develop hypertension. High blood pressure increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, which are leading causes of death in the United States. Nearly half of adults in the country have hypertension, and it caused nearly 700,000 deaths in 2021. The study analyzed the medical records of over 45,000 Covid-19 patients and nearly 14,000 influenza patients in New York City. It found that hospitalized Covid-19 patients were diagnosed with hypertension at about twice the rate of those who were not hospitalized. Even Covid-19 patients who were not hospitalized had a higher risk of developing hypertension compared to nonhospitalized flu patients. Certain demographic groups, such as those over 40 years old, Black individuals, and those with pre-existing conditions, were at a higher risk of developing hypertension after a Covid-19 infection. The study suggests that the Covid-19 virus could infect heart cells and disrupt blood pressure regulation, or that acute kidney injury during hospitalization might contribute to hypertension.

He aimed to administer 100 million vaccine shots in that time, but the U.S. has actually administered over 220 million shots since he took office. However, this may be due to reality outpacing his initial pledge rather than his vaccination prowess. The U.S. was already administering 900,000 daily doses on average when Biden took office, so reaching 100 million shots in 100 days was not as challenging as it seemed. Biden eventually increased the vaccination benchmark to 200 million shots, which was achieved on day 92 of his tenure. Some conservative critics argue that Biden didn't do much and simply benefited from the vaccine rollout that was already underway when Trump left office. However, Biden's team did take additional actions to boost vaccine supply and distribution. The challenge for the next 100 days will be reaching communities that are hesitant or indifferent to getting vaccinated. In terms of reopening schools, Biden promised that the majority of schools would be open by the end of his first 100 days if strong public health measures were in place. While schools across the country have mostly reopened, it is more complicated to attribute this solely to Biden. Trump had also pushed for schools to reopen, but teachers' unions argued that it was unsafe to do so. Biden's administration prioritized getting teachers vaccinated and providing funding for schools to implement safety measures, which may have contributed to the reopening of schools.

      "{'news': 'An imbalance of fungi in the gut could contribute to excessive inflammation in people with severe COVID-19 or long COVID, according to a recent study. The research found that individuals with severe disease had elevated levels of a fungus that can activate the immune system and induce long-lasting changes. This suggests that antifungal treatment could potentially provide relief to critically ill COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 can alter the microbial composition of the gut, allowing pathogens to enter the bloodstream. Some severely ill COVID-19 patients have also developed dangerous fungal infections in their lungs. The study examined blood and fecal samples from COVID-19 patients and found higher levels of gut fungi, particularly Candida species, in individuals with severe disease. The presence of certain fungal species, such as Candida albicans, has been shown to activate the immune system and trigger inflammation. The study also found that individuals with severe COVID-19 had elevated levels of antibodies against C. albicans, which were linked to the number of immune cells associated with inflammation. When mice were infected with C. albicans from severe COVID-19 patients and then exposed to SARS-CoV-2, more immune cells invaded their lungs and triggered inflammation compared to mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 alone. Treatment with an antifungal drug reduced the number and activity of these immune cells. The study also revealed that individuals with severe COVID-19 continued to have elevated levels of antibodies against C. albicans and immune cells primed to counter fungi even after recovering from the disease, suggesting a potential link between mycobiota changes during COVID-19 and inflammation associated with long COVID. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between gut fungi and COVID-19, including whether the observed changes in mycobiota are a result of the disease or a predisposing factor.

The researchers examined records from the Leprosy Clinic at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in London. They found that of the 52 people who went to the clinic in 2021, at least 49 were vaccinated. The study definition of a leprosy adverse event associated with a COVID-19 vaccine included developing leprosy or a leprosy reaction within 12 weeks of receiving a dose and the person having no previous history of leprosy or a leprosy reaction. Two people met the case definition. One developed borderline tuberculoid (BT) leprosy one week after a second dose. The other experienced a reaction 56 days after a dose. Both doses were Pfizer’s BNT162b2 vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccines can provoke a response from white blood cells, or T cells. The cells are believed to protect against COVID-19. T-cells can theoretically trigger Mycobacterium leprae, a bacteria that causes leprosy, leading to leprosy or a leprosy reaction, the researchers said. Other vaccines have been shown to trigger leprosy or leprosy reactions, including tuberculosis vaccines, and some people who receive repeated COVID-19 vaccinations have been shown to have weakened immune systems. The person diagnosed with leprosy is an 80-year-old man who has lived in the United Kingdom for 49 years. He suffered from symptoms including thickened nerves. The leprosy diagnosis was confirmed via skin biopsy. The man may be the first to acquire leprosy in the UK since 1954. The man improved over time and actually received a third dose of Pfizer’s vaccine. The reaction was recorded in a 27-year-old man who had taken multidrug therapy, a drug for leprosy, in the past. He developed red plaques and thickened nerves before arriving in the UK from an unidentified country. A biopsy supported the diagnosis. Of the 52 people who went to the Leprosy Clinic for diagnosis and/or treatment in 2021, all but two reported their vaccination status. Of those 50, 49 were vaccinated. Five of the patients at the clinic were newly diagnosed with leprosy in 2021. Five others had a type one reaction.

      "{'news': \"Official data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveals a significant increase in fatal cancers among Americans who have received Covid mRNA injections. The data shows a correlation between the rise in cancer and the public rollout of Covid mRNA shots. The U.S. federal government's own official data confirms that the risk of developing cancer following Covid vaccination increases by a staggering 143,233%. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database contains historical data on adverse reactions reported against every vaccine administered in the United States. Analysis of the VAERS data shows a dramatic spike in cancer cases among those vaccinated with the Covid shots. Comparing the number of cancer cases reported as adverse reactions to the Covid injections with other available vaccines reveals a significant difference. The number of adverse events related to cancer reported per 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine administered is 0.43, while for flu vaccines, it is just 0.0003. This means that Covid vaccination is 1433.33 times more likely to cause cancer than flu vaccination. Scientific evidence also suggests that the Covid mRNA injections can cause cancer of the ovaries, pancreas, and breast. The spike protein produced by the mRNA shots can damage the DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes, potentially leading to cancer. Additionally, patent documentation from Moderna, one of the manufacturers of Covid vaccines, shows that the shots contain DNA fragments linked to birth defects and cancer. The failure of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address this issue raises concerns, especially as several FDA officials secured jobs with Moderna after approving the shots. Dr. Robert Malone, one of the inventors of mRNA vaccine technology, highlighted these concerns during a recent hearing on Capitol Hill.

Thi\", 'reason': \"g to US cardiologist Dr. Thomas Levy, a minimum of 7 million Americans have experienced heart damage from Covid vaccines, and it is possible that over 100 million people in America have some degree of heart damage from the injections. The spike protein from the vaccines is believed to be affecting the heart. Vaccinated pilots have also experienced heart damage, leading to changes in Federal Aviation Administration guidelines. The FAA has widened the electrocardiogram parameters for pilots, suggesting that the vaccine has caused many pilots to fail their screening. It is estimated that over 50 million Americans have sustained some amount of heart damage from the shot.##\\n\\nThe evidence provided does not support the claim made in the news paragraph regarding heart damage from Covid vaccines.

      "{'news': \"A new study conducted by microbiologist Kevin McKernan and Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi has found HIV-infected green monkey DNA in both Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The study also discovered simian virus 40 (SV40) promoters in the vaccines, which have been linked to cancer in humans. The DNA contamination found in the vaccines exceeds regulatory limits and could potentially alter the human genome, causing the immune system to attack its own cells. SV40 promoters were inadvertently introduced into the human population through the polio vaccine. Both McKernan and Bhakdi argue that all mRNA vaccines should be immediately halted due to the significant risks involved.\", 'evidence list': ['7ikelfru', 'onoqalxw', '7pkusbl7'], 'ground truth': 0, 'prediction': \"ragraph claims that a study found HIV-infected green monkey DNA in Pfizer and Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines, along with simian virus 40 (SV40) promoters that could potentially alter the human genome and cause significant risks.
