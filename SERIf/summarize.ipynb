      "Some people may experience \"long colds,\" or long-term symptoms following common colds, flu, pneumonia, or other respiratory illnesses, similar to the pattern seen in long COVID, according to a study from Queen Mary University of London. The study found that even people with acute respiratory infections who tested negative for COVID-19 could still experience long-term symptoms, including coughing, stomach pain, and diarrhea. Those with long COVID were more likely to report ongoing problems with sense of taste or smell, lightheadedness, or dizziness. The study analyzed questionnaire data from over 10,000 UK adults and found that long-lasting symptoms often go undiagnosed due to a wide range of symptoms and lack of testing. Understanding the long-term effects of COVID-19 and other infections is important for identifying appropriate treatment and care. Recent data from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics shows that millions of Americans report having long COVID, with women being more likely than men to report the condition.\n",

      "Researchers have found a connection between the plasma lipid profile of a person and the severity of COVID-19 disease. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) impacts lipid metabolism in the body, which has implications for COVID-19 infection and mRNA vaccination. The interaction between the S protein and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) may contribute to adverse effects observed in some individuals following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Deuterated lipids were used to understand the effect of lipid saturation on the ability of the S protein to hijack lipid metabolism during infection. The S protein has a stronger ability to remove cholesterol and polyunsaturated lipids compared to saturated and monounsaturated lipids. The study showed that the S protein changes HDL function depending on the lipid serum profile of a person. This interaction between the S protein and HDL may contribute to adverse effects observed in some individuals following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.\n",

      "mRNA-based vaccines have the potential to fight infectious diseases and cancer, and new delivery methods are being developed to maximize their effectiveness and minimize side effects. The current delivery vehicles sometimes deliver the mRNA to the wrong places or hold onto it instead of releasing it into cells. The spike protein in the COVID-19 virus is essential for its ability to infect cells, making it a target for the immune system. There have been concerns about the spike protein being toxic, but experts suggest that the spike proteins produced by the vaccine are similar to those produced by the virus and are less likely to be toxic. Spike proteins induced by the vaccine stick to the cell's outer membrane, where they can be easily detected by the immune system. The spike proteins produced by the vaccine are likely to be less toxic than those produced during viral infections.\n",

Researchers have found that the spike proteins from Khosta-2 can infect human cells and are resistant to current vaccines. This discovery highlights the need for universal vaccines that can protect against all sarbecoviruses, rather than just specific variants of SARS-CoV-2. While most sarbecoviruses cannot infect human cells, Khosta-2 poses a potential threat. The virus can use its spike protein to attach to a receptor protein found in human cells, and current vaccines do not neutralize it. Although Khosta-2 lacks some genes involved in human pathogenesis, there is a risk of it recombining with other viruses to create a potentially more dangerous virus.\n",

Long COVID, also known as COVID long-haulers, refers to the lingering effects of the disease that persist for more than four weeks after the initial infection clears. Symptoms can range from headaches to chronic fatigue to shortness of breath, and the long-term impacts are largely unknown. The study aims to identify who is at risk, how recovery varies, and potential prevention and treatment options. The researchers emphasize the importance of properly defining long COVID, as symptoms can vary greatly among patients. The study will recruit from the ReCOVer Long COVID Clinic at BMC and include a control group of individuals without long COVID symptoms. The researchers hope to clarify the biological and clinical features of long COVID and its associated risk factors. They also highlight the need to study long COVID urgently due to its potential long-term effects and the dismissal of patients with vague symptoms, particularly women. While it appears that being vaccinated may reduce the likelihood of developing long COVID symptoms, more research is needed to confirm this.\n",

      "Researchers at UC Berkeley, the Gladstone Institutes, and the Innovative Genomics Institute have found that antibodies generated against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants are less effective against the omicron variant. The omicron variant, which was first detected in South Africa in late 2021, has the most mutations and spreads more rapidly than other variants. The study revealed that the immune response, especially with two vaccine shots or a prior infection, is less efficient against omicron compared to other variants. Omicron has a high mutation and transmission rate due to enhanced assembly and immune escape. It can evade antibodies at a higher rate than any other variant. The study used virus-like particles to test people's ability to withstand omicron and other variants. While the booster shot temporarily increases antibody levels and provides better protection against omicron, the new variants continue to change and evade the immune response. The researchers suggest using the virus-like particle system to measure people's neutralizing titers and tailor vaccination accordingly. The next step for researchers is to study new variants as they evolve and understand why some variants have enhanced assembly and immune escape. The study highlights the need for precautions such as wearing masks, avoiding indoor eating, maintaining distance, and avoiding large gatherings to prevent the spread of omicron.\n",

      "A new study conducted by Johns Hopkins researchers in Baltimore, Maryland, has provided further evidence that COVID-19 booster shots are crucial for maintaining long-term immunity, especially among older adults. The study, published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, supports the CDC's guidelines recommending booster shots. Previous research had shown a decline in antibody response among vaccine recipients after six months, particularly in older adults. The new study tested antibody levels in blood samples from adults aged 75-98 who had received two initial doses of mRNA vaccines. After receiving a booster shot, antibody levels in older adults matched those in the younger group, and the third dose also eliminated disparities between males and females in the same age group. The study emphasizes the importance of continued research on factors that may affect immunity, such as vaccine type, age, sex, and frailty. The research was funded by various organizations, including the National Institute on Aging, the National Cancer Institute, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",

The study included over 485,000 postmenopausal women who had been vaccinated between December 2020 and May 2021. The researchers compared the rates of postmenopausal bleeding before and after vaccination and found that there was only a slight increase in the number of women experiencing bleeding after vaccination. The findings should reassure women who may have been hesitant to get vaccinated due to concerns about abnormal bleeding. The study also highlights the importance of considering reproductive health side effects in future vaccine trials.\n",

Patients who went on to develop severe COVID-19 exhibited a much more muted antiviral response in the cells collected from early nasal swabs compared to patients with a mild course of the disease. The lack of a strong initial antiviral response may allow the virus to spread more rapidly, increasing the chances of progression to severe disease.

      "A new study conducted by a sociologist at the University of Houston has found disparities in the initial distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. The study examined the early weeks of the vaccine rollout in the five largest urban counties in Texas and revealed a clear issue of race and existing inequalities in healthcare. The research showed that Black and Latino neighborhoods were less likely to receive vaccines during the rollout due to a lack of healthcare resources. The study also found that as the percentage of Black and Latino residents in a zip code increased, the number of vaccine sites decreased. The findings highlight the need for more healthcare resources in underserved neighborhoods and the importance of educating more physicians of color.\n",

The study demonstrates that vaccines and social distancing are effective in limiting the spread of the virus among firefighters and reducing its impact on the workforce. The research team, consisting of risk management experts and epidemiological modeling experts, developed a complex model that paired historical data on fire assignments with an epidemiological model to understand the spread of COVID-19. The study found that a high vaccination rate and adherence to social distancing measures resulted in fewer missed workdays and less lost pay. The research also highlighted the importance of communication around behaviors outside the fire environment, as the number of COVID-19 infections acquired off-fire was substantially higher than those acquired on-fire. This research provides practical recommendations for creating a more resilient and safe workforce in future fire seasons.\n",

The study found that inadequate sleep may increase the risk of flare-ups in COPD patients by up to 95%. These flare-ups can lead to irreversible lung damage and accelerate disease progression and mortality. The findings may partially explain why African American patients with COPD tend to fare worse than white patients, as they are more likely to have poor quality sleep due to living in crowded spaces and working in jobs with varying schedules. The study followed 1,647 COPD patients over a three-year period and compared flare-up incidence with self-reported sleep quality. The researchers found that poor sleep increased the chance of a flare-up by 25% to 95% compared to optimal sleep. African Americans reported poorer sleep than white participants, with 63% versus 52% reporting poor sleep. The study highlights the importance of considering sleep as a factor in evaluating and managing COPD patients.\n",

The study followed over 10,300 children in 10 countries and found that approximately 3% experienced severe outcomes within two weeks of their visit to an emergency room. Severe outcomes included cardiac or cardiovascular complications, neurologic, respiratory, or infectious problems, and four children died. The study also found that older age, pre-existing chronic conditions, and symptom duration were important risk factors for severe outcomes. However, the study debunked the suggestion that asthma or very young infants were at a higher risk. The findings provide reassurance to parents and clinicians for children managed in the community and help identify children at particular risk for severe outcomes. The study will also assist emergency physicians in triaging pediatric patients more efficiently.\n",

The study found that vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies primarily target one domain of the spike protein, which is crucial for the virus to enter host cells. These antibodies also play a key role in eliciting a broad antibody response against many variants. The findings provide strategies for developing variant-resistant vaccines and sarbecovirus vaccines for future pandemic preparedness. The study also identified specific domains on the spike protein that are targeted by neutralizing antibodies, which may explain the rapid accumulation of mutations in variants. Targeting these domains could be useful in developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and related sarbecoviruses.\n",

The study compared 17,871 COVID-19 patients with 35,742 uninfected controls and found that those who did not require hospital admission were nearly 3 times as likely to have blood clots and more than 10 times as likely to die. Those who were hospitalized had higher risks of all cardiovascular outcomes considered, including heart failure, stroke, and atrial fibrillation. The study also found that most cardiovascular disease diagnoses occurred within the first 30 days of infection, but the heightened risk remained beyond 30 days.

Severe COVID-19 infection in pregnant women increases the risk of harmful outcomes for mothers and babies. A study by the National Institutes of Health found no link between COVID-19 vaccines and infertility, but SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a short-term reduction in male fertility. A modeling study estimates that at least 5.2 million children have lost a parent or caregiver due to COVID-19. England's 14-day travel quarantine measures have been effective in reducing COVID-19 spread, especially for travelers aged 16-20 years. Omicron, a new variant, is associated with fewer lower and more upper respiratory tract symptoms. Concerns have been raised about two subvariants of Omicron, BA.1 and BA.2, which have greater transmissibility and potential vaccine implications. Data from ongoing trials show that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine increases antibody responses to several variants, including Omicron, when given as a third dose booster.

The tool uses computer simulations of molecular interactions to predict mutations that allow better binding to host receptors and evasion of antibodies. By understanding these mutations, researchers can be better prepared to detect, prevent, and treat emerging and future variants. The team used quantum mechanical modeling to make predictions about the infectivity and immune response evasion of the Omicron variant and other SARS-CoV-2 variants. The findings suggest that Omicron may have the potential to continue evolving stronger binding to increase transmission and infectivity. However, not all mutations in the spike protein's targeting system are beneficial for binding, indicating that other factors may also play a role in variant evolution.

      "New research from Emory University suggests that COVID-19 can trigger temporary autoimmunity in some patients. The study found that during severe COVID-19 infections, the immune system generates a wide variety of autoantibodies that attack the body's own tissues. However, after the infection subsides, these autoantibodies decay and are mostly removed from the body. In some cases, levels of certain types of autoantibodies remain elevated for months after the initial infection, particularly in patients with long COVID. The researchers suggest that testing for autoantibodies during acute infection could help identify patients who may need early intervention. Additionally, therapies that deplete autoantibody activity may improve long-term recovery outcomes. The study also found high levels of autoantibodies in hospitalized patients with bacterial pneumonia, indicating that autoimmunity can be triggered in other settings of intense inflammation. Further research is needed to understand the role of autoantibodies in persistent symptoms of long COVID.\n",

A study conducted by researchers from the University of Washington and other institutions found that the number of infected people in a household was the factor most closely linked to the infant's likelihood of being infected. The study analyzed surveys and antibody results of COVID-positive mothers and their infants for two months following maternal infection. About half of the infants of COVID-positive mothers developed symptoms or antibodies indicative of COVID-19 infection. The rates of infection and symptoms in those infants were similar to those of other household children, but lower than for fathers and other household adults. The study also found that breastfeeding did not appear to increase the risk of infection for infants. Overall, the risks to COVID-19 exposed infants were minimal, supporting recommendations for infected mothers and caregivers to continue infant care and feeding as usual, including breastfeeding.\n",

They found that the immune protein known as CARD8 can serve as a trip wire to detect these viruses. Interestingly, CARD8 functions differently among different species and even varies between individuals in the human population. Some humans have lost the ability to sense coronavirus infections but have gained the ability to sense other viruses. The researchers also found that the bat version of CARD8 is not able to sense coronaviruses, which may explain why bats are easily infected by these viruses.

The vaccines are still effective in protecting against severe disease from XBB.1.5, and antivirals can still treat infection. The period of infectiousness for XBB.1.5 is similar to other omicron variants. People who have been infected with an earlier omicron variant are likely susceptible to reinfection with XBB.1.5. The bivalent booster vaccine is still effective in protecting against severe disease, though perhaps not as much against infection. There is currently no guidance on whether a second bivalent booster will be recommended. It is important for eligible individuals to get the bivalent booster, especially those in high-risk groups. Paxlovid is still effective in treating COVID-19, but it is not being prescribed as frequently as it should be. Case rates are expected to increase in the coming weeks, and it is still unclear how much transmission is due to seasonal activity versus the XBB.1.5 variant.\n",

BET proteins have two roles in the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and human cells: they provide the virus with a way to enter cells, but they also help cells defend themselves. The study discovered that blocking all BET proteins may not be effective in treating COVID-19 patients who are already infected. The research also revealed that SARS-CoV-2 directly interacts with BRD2 and BRD4, two members of the BET protein family.

The findings suggest that existing drugs that block all BET proteins may not be suitable for treating COVID-19, but targeting specific BET proteins or parts of these proteins could be a potential avenue for future therapeutics.\n",

      "Researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine have discovered that the first mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, evolved to counter vulnerabilities caused by the initial mutation that started the pandemic. The mutation, known as D614G, was not an adaptation to its new human host but rather a response to changes in the spike gene that allowed the virus to spread between people. The initial mutation enabled the virus to infect cells more efficiently but also disrupted other functions of the spike protein. The D614G mutation corrected these disrupted functions while maintaining the rapid infection benefits. The researchers found that the D614G mutation redirects the spike protein and reduces its abundance on the surface of infected cells, making it more difficult for the immune system to identify and kill the virus-containing cells. Further studies are being conducted to understand the effects of spike protein mutations in more recent virus strains.

The study compared hospitalizations from respiratory infections caused by COVID-19 and non-SARS-CoV-2 infections. Data from two hospitals in Bristol showed that over 55% of respiratory disease hospitalizations during the pandemic's peak were caused by non-SARS-CoV-2 infections. The study highlights the burden of respiratory infections on healthcare systems and emphasizes the need for appropriate healthcare planning and resource allocation. The findings suggest that despite public health measures, there was still a high incidence of non-COVID-19 respiratory infections alongside COVID-19 patients.\n",

      "A new study suggests that the risk of potentially life-threatening blood clots remains for almost a year after a COVID-19 infection. The study analyzed health records of 48 million unvaccinated adults from the first wave of the pandemic and found that COVID-19 increased the risk of blood clots for at least 49 weeks. The research showed that even people with mild or moderate disease were affected. The study also revealed that in the first week after a COVID-19 diagnosis, individuals were 21 times more likely to have a heart attack or stroke, which are mainly caused by blood clots. The risk of blood clots in the veins was 33 times greater in the first week after a COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the risk of blood clots reduced over time, with a 1.3 times higher risk for clots in the arteries and 1.8 times higher risk for clots in the veins by 26 to 49 weeks. The authors suggest that preventive strategies, such as medication to lower blood pressure, could help reduce cases of serious clots. The study highlights the longer-term effects of COVID-19 that are still being understood.\n",

      "Researchers at Penn Medicine have developed a new method to increase the effectiveness of nanomedicines. The technique involves using a complement inhibitor called Factor I to prevent proteins from attacking the treatment-carrying nanoparticles. This allows the nanoparticles to better reach their targets within the body. Nanoparticles are often used as delivery vehicles for treatments or vaccines, such as mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. The immune system's complement proteins typically attack and destroy these nanoparticles, preventing them from reaching their intended destinations. By coating the nanoparticles with natural suppressors of complement activation, the researchers were able to significantly reduce this problem. This new method could potentially allow for safer and more efficient use of nanomedicines in treating various diseases.

The compound was found to be better than a placebo at decreasing inflammatory markers and reducing markers of neurological injury. Patients treated with OP-101 had a significantly lower risk of mechanical ventilation or death compared to those receiving a placebo. The compound was well tolerated and could potentially benefit patients with other diseases that cause systemic inflammatory responses. OP-101 has previously shown anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects in animal models of inflammatory disease. The study was conducted by a team of researchers from various institutions and the results were published in Science Translational Medicine.\n",

      "Awake prone positioning does not offer benefit in reducing intubation for COVID-19 induced acute respiratory failure, according to a large multicenter, randomized clinical trial. The study found no difference in the risk of endotracheal intubation requirement at 30 days between awake prone positioning and standard positioning for patients with COVID-19 who suffered from acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Awake prone positioning, in which a non-intubated patient lies face down, was adopted as an intervention to improve oxygenation within the lungs. However, the study showed that this strategy had a limited role in preventing patients from requiring mechanical ventilation. The researchers emphasized the need for careful evaluation to identify who may benefit from this strategy.\n",

      "COVID-19 caused a surge in premature births, but vaccines helped return the early birth rate to pre-pandemic levels, according to a study analyzing California birth records. The risk of preterm births increased by 1.2 percentage points due to maternal COVID infection. The virus endangers pregnancies by causing immune and inflammation responses and deterioration of the placenta. In California, the likelihood of giving birth more than three weeks before the due date was 5.4 percentage points higher for mothers with COVID-19. However, the excess risk of preterm birth fell in early 2021 and dropped steeply in 2022, with no excess risk for infants born to mothers with COVID-19 infection. Vaccines played a role in decreasing the risk, especially in areas with high vaccination rates. ZIP codes with the highest vaccination rates saw a faster decline in the excess risk of preterm birth. Preterm birth is associated with various health problems and costs. The study provides evidence of the positive effects of vaccination in preventing premature births and can help address concerns about vaccine safety for pregnant individuals. The researchers emphasize the importance of getting vaccinations and boosters, as the pandemic is still evolving.\n",

The technology, which is described in Nature Medicine, is an optimized version of the CARMEN platform developed in 2020. mCARMEN is faster, more sensitive, and easier to implement in clinical and surveillance labs. It can detect multiple viruses and variants quickly, and it can also measure the amount of virus in a sample. The researchers demonstrated that mCARMEN can distinguish between 21 different human respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and it can accurately identify different SARS-CoV-2 variant lineages. The technology was used during the Omicron surge in Massachusetts to provide a provisional look at the rising prevalence of the variant and guide treatment options for COVID-19 patients. mCARMEN has the potential to be used for virus surveillance and monitoring emerging variants, as well as for detecting and discriminating bacterial infections and monitoring antibiotic resistance.\n",

      "A large study from Germany suggests that kids and adolescents have the same relative risk of experiencing COVID-19 symptoms 90 days or more after infection as adults. Another study by the World Health Organization (WHO) reveals that approximately two-thirds of the world's population has SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. While kids and adolescents have fewer severe outcomes from COVID-19 compared to adults, little is known about long COVID symptoms in this age group. The German study found that kids and adults have a similar risk of experiencing post-COVID symptoms at 90 days following infection. Symptoms such as cough, fever, headache, malaise/fatigue/exhaustion, and throat or chest pain were common among both kids and adults. However, symptoms like loss of taste or smell, fever, and shortness of breath were more commonly seen in adults. Pediatric long COVID patients may require different interventions, and some may need reassurance or a graduated exercise program. The WHO study on seroprevalence shows that by September 2021, approximately two-thirds of the global population were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 from either infection or vaccination. Seroprevalence has increased considerably over time, with high-income countries in the Americas and Europe having over 90% seroprevalence by early 2022. However, regional variation exists, and over one-third of the global population remains seronegative to the virus.\n",

The studies found that 18.4% of participants had lingering symptoms at 6 months, 10.1% at 12 months, and 7.8% at 18 months. The most common long COVID symptoms were shortness of breath, joint pain, loss of smell or taste, weakness, impaired attention or concentration, memory loss, and sleep disorders. Risk factors for lingering symptoms included age over 60, female sex, a history of cancer or tobacco use, obesity, and having more than four symptoms during infection. Two studies presented at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting revealed that even mild COVID-19 can cause cognitive deficits and brain damage that lasts for months. The studies found that COVID-19 patients required more brain resources and had impaired fine-motor skills and spatial abilities. Stressful life events were also found to be associated with a higher risk of persistent symptoms and worse outcomes in long COVID patients. Financial or food insecurity, death of a close contact, and new disability were the strongest predictors of worse outcomes. The researchers emphasized the need for therapies that address the trauma of stressful life events in the treatment of long COVID.\n",

They used algorithms to analyze the human genome and identified certain polymorphisms in the GC gene, which encodes vitamin D-binding protein, as risk biomarkers for vitamin D deficiency. They found a correlation between these variables and COVID-19 severity in almost 500 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Portugal. This research highlights the importance of serum vitamin D levels and vitamin D-binding protein in SARS-CoV-2 infection and has implications for biomarker discovery.

      "A T-cell vaccine for COVID-19 may provide longer-lasting immunity than current vaccines, according to a study conducted by Penn State researchers in partnership with Evaxion Biotech. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence-generated T-cell vaccine in a live viral challenge model. In the study, mice vaccinated with the T-cell-based vaccine had a survival rate of 87.5% compared to 10% in the control group. The vaccine also cleared the infection within 14 days post-challenge. The T-cell vaccine targets multiple epitopes from various proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, ensuring a sustained coverage of future variants. Unlike antibody-based vaccines, T-cell-mediated immunity is usually long-lasting, eliminating the need for repeated booster doses. The researchers believe that a second-generation T-cell-based vaccine could be more effective and last longer. The vaccine was developed using the RAVEN platform, which uses artificial intelligence to predict ideal targets for vaccines. The platform could also be used to develop better influenza vaccines. The study was supported by Innovation Fund Denmark, and the research was conducted at Penn State's BSL-3 laboratory.\n",

The study looked at trends in HIV testing, PrEP prescriptions, and other services and found a decrease in the second quarter followed by an increase in the third quarter. Antiretroviral therapy services remained steady throughout 2020, attributed to increased use of telehealth and home delivery of medications. The researchers emphasized the importance of supporting prevention and care services outside of clinical settings during disruptions like a public health emergency. Additional funding and relaxed requirements also contributed to the rebound.\n",

      "Tiny nets woven from DNA strands have been developed by researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to capture the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus. These DNA nets can be used for rapid diagnostic testing and potentially as a route for antiviral treatment. The nets were designed to bind to the spike protein, and when bound, they emit a fluorescent signal that can be detected by a handheld device in about 10 minutes. The DNA nets were able to detect the virus at very low levels, equivalent to gold-standard PCR tests. The technique is cost-effective, easy to use, and can detect the entire virus, distinguishing it from non-infectious fragments. Additionally, the DNA nets inhibited the virus's spread in live cell cultures, suggesting their potential as therapeutic agents. The researchers aim to adapt the DNA net platform for other viruses and develop a unified technology for rapid and low-cost testing.\n",

      "The second year of the COVID-19 pandemic was deadlier for middle-aged adults compared to the first year, according to an analysis of publicly available data. The study found that while the first year was most deadly for those over age 65, the second year hit middle-aged adults the hardest. The researchers attributed this to factors such as the surge of the delta variant and a decrease in preventive care during the pandemic. The study also highlighted the importance of vaccination as a preventative measure, as higher vaccination rates among the elderly in the second year reduced mortality among them. The researchers emphasized the need for better public health infrastructure and real-time data to inform decision-making and address the increase in non-COVID-19 deaths.\n",

      "A longitudinal study of 1,899 pregnant women nationwide reveals that pregnant women of lower socioeconomic status and/or who are African American are less likely to have the intention of getting a COVID-19 vaccine and actually receiving it. The study found significant vaccination hesitancy in socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, which is concerning given the vulnerability of pregnant women and disadvantaged populations. Factors such as financial status, education level, and lack of private health insurance were associated with lower vaccine intention and uptake. African Americans reported the lowest vaccine intention among all racial and ethnic groups. The study suggests that reducing medical care accessibility barriers and providing information within communities about vaccine safety and efficacy could help increase vaccination rates in perinatal populations. However, the study had limitations, including self-reported vaccination status and a sample that was not representative of the entire U.S. population. The lower uptake of COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant women facing barriers due to marginalized identity or insufficient socioeconomic resources is particularly concerning due to their already higher rates of poor health and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.\n",

      "A new study from Denmark found that more than half of people with severe cases of long COVID did not improve after 18 months. The study also revealed that severe symptoms lasted for at least 18 months regardless of the variant of SARS-CoV-2 that infected the person. The study suggested that long COVID treatments should focus on aiding those with the most severe cases. The prevalence of people infected with the Omicron variant indicated that a substantial number of them may develop long COVID.\n",

      "A large study has found a link between COVID-19 and an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). However, vaccination against COVID-19 appears to reduce the risk of GBS. The study analyzed health data from over 3 million people in Israel and found that those with a recent COVID infection were six times more likely to have GBS. Of the 3 million people in the study, 76 developed GBS. The risk of GBS was measured within 6 weeks after a person had COVID, and those who had recently received an mRNA-based COVID vaccine were 50% less likely to get GBS. The cause of GBS is unknown, and there is no cure. Symptoms include weakness in the hands and feet, which can progress to paralysis. GBS can be life-threatening, but most people recover with no further problems.\n",

      "Stanford University and Yale University scientists have found a link between COVID-19 brain fog and \"chemo brain,\" a condition experienced by patients who have undergone chemotherapy. The study, published in the journal Cell, revealed that both COVID-19 patients and those with chemo brain suffer from excessive inflammation and damage to nerves in the brain. The researchers found that the same brain cells and processes were affected in both conditions. The inflammation of a protein called cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid was observed in those infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This inflammation leads to increased damage to myelin, a protective coating of the axon, which slows down the transmission of nerve signals. COVID-19 patients have reported symptoms such as trouble with concentration, memory function, and attention, similar to those with chemo brain. The study also found that the genes expressed in microglia after COVID-19 overlapped with those expressed in other neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. The researchers hope to use this newfound link to inform treatments for COVID-19 brain fog, drawing from the research on chemo brain.\n",

These cases are rare, but there is a need for more guidance on how to respond to relapses after taking the medication. Paxlovid has been found to be highly effective at reducing hospitalization and death from COVID-19. In the rare event of a relapse, symptoms may include congestion, fatigue, or mild symptoms similar to the original infection. The cause of relapses is still being studied, but it may be due to the virus not being completely cleared from the body or individual differences in how the medication is absorbed and metabolized. The FDA does not recommend taking a second round of Paxlovid if symptoms of relapse occur. It is important to continue following health protocols and seek medical advice if symptoms worsen.\n",

This was particularly evident among non-immigrants aged 85 and older, which is likely attributed to the high concentration of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care homes. The report suggests that this phenomenon may explain why Canada differed from global trends, where more men died from COVID-19. The majority of COVID-19 deaths in Canada occurred in long-term care homes, with those aged 85 and older accounting for over half of the deaths. The report also highlights that COVID-19 risk factors are higher among Canadian men, and the death rate among immigrant workers in health care and social assistance was higher among men despite more women working in the field. However, the sex differences in COVID-19 deaths disappeared by summer 2021, possibly due to high vaccination rates in long-term care homes, which significantly reduced infections and serious outcomes.\n",

      "A new study from the University of Pennsylvania has found that a vaccine-like mRNA injection can be used to reprogram patients' immune cells to attack a specific target. This approach, similar to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, demonstrated success in reprogramming T cells to attack heart fibroblast cells, leading to a reversal of fibrosis in mice. The researchers believe this technology could be a scalable and affordable way to address various medical conditions, including heart failure. Unlike traditional CAR T cell therapy, this new technique does not require harvesting and genetic reprogramming of a patient's T cells in the lab. Instead, mRNA is designed to encode a T-cell receptor that targets activated fibroblasts and is encapsulated within lipid nanoparticles. The mRNA is taken up by T cells, reprogramming them temporarily to attack fibroblasts. The reprogramming lasts for a few days before the T cells revert to normal. The researchers are hopeful that this mRNA-based CAR T cell technology can eventually be tested in clinical trials.\n",

      "The omicron variant of COVID-19 has raised questions about whether it could act as a vaccine, potentially leading to herd immunity. Researchers have found that omicron spreads quickly, causes milder disease, and may offer protection against other variants. However, omicron should not be considered a viable alternative to existing vaccines due to the risks of severe illness and long-term health effects associated with COVID-19 infection. Vaccines work by training the immune system to fight against the virus, either by exposing the host to critical molecules or a weakened form of the virus. Omicron mimics live attenuated vaccines by causing milder infection and triggering a strong immune response against the delta variant. The high transmission of omicron combined with ongoing vaccination efforts could help achieve herd immunity, but it is unlikely to eradicate COVID-19 completely. Antibodies and killer T cells play a crucial role in the immune response to the virus, and booster shots are needed to maintain immunity. Memory cells, which recognize the virus upon reinfection, are critical for establishing long-lasting immunity. The hope is that omicron, along with COVID-19 vaccines, will better equip the population to fight against future variants and reduce hospitalization and death rates.\n",

The study, which used data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative, found that COVID patients had a 3.8% rate of developing a psychiatric disorder, compared to 3.0% for other respiratory tract infections. The researchers specifically looked at anxiety disorders and mood disorders and found a minor increase in risk for anxiety disorders but no change in risk for mood disorders. The study highlights the need for proactive mental health care for COVID patients and the potential strain on the healthcare system if more people seek psychiatric care. The lead author of the study is also working on a follow-up paper to assess the association between long COVID symptoms and new-onset mental illness.\n",

      "The Oregon State University scientist who led the discovery that hemp compounds can block the coronavirus from entering human cells believes that preclinical trials will happen within the next few months. Preclinical trials are necessary before any clinical testing in humans can begin. The researcher, Richard van Breemen, and his team found that two cannabinoid acids found in hemp can bind to the spike protein of the virus, preventing infection. The compounds, cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), have a good safety profile in humans and are equally effective against variants of SARS-CoV-2. The study has garnered attention from companies interested in collaborating with Oregon State for further research on the hemp compounds. Hemp is a source of fiber, food, and animal feed, and its extracts and compounds are used in various products. The discovery of these hemp compounds opens up possibilities for new therapeutic agents in the prevention and treatment of diseases and infections.\n",

Men are more likely to develop diabetes than women, and those who were hospitalized or admitted to intensive care were even more at risk. The long-term effects of Covid-19 are becoming increasingly concerning, with lingering effects that can last a lifetime. While the link between Covid-19 and diabetes is not yet fully understood, there are plausible biological explanations for the connection. The coronavirus infects the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, causing cell death. Stress and the inflammatory response associated with Covid-19 can also contribute to the development of diabetes. Other viral infections, such as hepatitis C, have also been linked to an increased risk of diabetes.

The study compared medical records of Covid patients with patients who had not contracted the virus and found that Covid patients were 36% more likely to have long-term gastrointestinal problems. The most common diagnoses were acid-related disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease. Serious inflammatory illnesses, like acute pancreatitis and cholangitis, were also more common among Covid patients. Long Covid patients were also at higher risk of gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The study did not identify whether certain previous health conditions put people at greater risk of post-Covid gastrointestinal problems. However, the study did find that people with mild initial infections were still at greater risk than those who were not infected.

Trillions of microorganisms live in and on our bodies, helping us to digest food, protecting us from harmful pathogens and more. Although much of the microbiome consists of bacteria, past research has shown that the fungal portion — the mycobiota — interacts with the immune system, too. Previous studies have shown that many people with COVID-19 have guts with altered microbial make-ups and disrupted protective barriers, which could allow pathogens to enter the blood. And some individuals critically ill with COVID-19 have contracted dangerous fungal infections in their lungs. Immunologist Iliyan Iliev at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City and his colleagues wanted to further investigate the link between the mycobiota and COVID-19. The researchers examined blood from 91 people hospitalized with the disease in 2020. Almost three-quarters of these people had severe COVID-19, who received more than six litres of supplementary oxygen a minute or invasive mechanical ventilation, whereas the rest had moderate or mild disease. Compared with 36 individuals who had never tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, people with severe COVID-19 produced about four times as many antibodies against three fungal species commonly found in the gut, including the yeast Candida albicans. A high prevalence of antibodies suggests that these people had elevated amounts of those fungi. Faecal samples collected in early 2021 from 10 people with COVID-19 also showed that they had higher overall levels of gut fungi, especially of Candida species, relative to 10 healthy individuals. For these people, the abundance of Candida was positively correlated with disease severity. The presence of some fungal species, C. albicans in particular, has been shown to activate the immune system. In a subset of people with severe COVID-19, the number of antibodies against C. albicans in their blood was linked to the number of immune cells called neutrophils, which can trigger inflammation. When the researchers infected mice with C. albicans extracted from people with severe COVID-19, and then infected them with SARS-CoV-2, they observed that more neutrophils invaded the animals’ lungs and activated an inflammatory response than in mice with SARS-CoV-2 alone. If they gave these mice an antifungal drug, it lowered the number and activity of neutrophils. The study also found that people with severe COVID-19 continued to have raised levels of antibodies against C. albicans and neutrophil precursors primed to counter fungi long after they had recovered from the disease — up to one year later in some people. These factors hint that mycobiota changes during a SARS-CoV-2 infection could contribute to inflammation associated with long COVID. Researchers agree that more work is needed to probe the link between gut fungi and COVID-19. It remains unclear whether the observed changes to the mycobiota in people with COVID-19 resulted from the disease or preceded it and made people more susceptible. If future studies reveal more about the mechanisms involved, existing antifungal treatments could be repurposed to help people with COVID-19.\n",
      "An imbalance of fungi in the gut could contribute to excessive inflammation in people with severe COVID-19 or long COVID, according to a recent study. The research found that individuals with severe disease had elevated levels of a fungus that can activate the immune system and induce long-lasting changes. This suggests that antifungal treatment could potentially provide relief to critically ill COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 can alter the microbial composition of the gut, allowing pathogens to enter the bloodstream. Some severely ill COVID-19 patients have also developed dangerous fungal infections in their lungs. The study examined blood and fecal samples from COVID-19 patients and found higher levels of gut fungi, particularly Candida species, in individuals with severe disease. The presence of certain fungal species, such as Candida albicans, has been shown to activate the immune system and trigger inflammation. The study also found that individuals with severe COVID-19 had elevated levels of antibodies against C. albicans, which were linked to the number of immune cells associated with inflammation. When mice were infected with C. albicans from severe COVID-19 patients and then exposed to SARS-CoV-2, more immune cells invaded their lungs and triggered inflammation compared to mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 alone. Treatment with an antifungal drug reduced the number and activity of these immune cells. The study also revealed that individuals with severe COVID-19 continued to have elevated levels of antibodies against C. albicans and immune cells primed to counter fungi even after recovering from the disease, suggesting a potential link between mycobiota changes during COVID-19 and inflammation associated with long COVID. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between gut fungi and COVID-19, including whether the observed changes in mycobiota are a result of the disease or a predisposing factor. If future studies uncover more about the mechanisms involved, existing antifungal treatments could be repurposed to help COVID-19 patients.\n",

      "mRNA vaccines have been successful in saving lives during the COVID-19 pandemic and have recently been awarded a Nobel prize. The technology behind mRNA vaccines has attracted significant investment, which will further research and development in using mRNA for treating infectious diseases, cancers, and genetic disorders. mRNA vaccines have been praised for their speed and effectiveness in generating a strong immune response. They can be quickly reformulated to address new virus variants or used as a rapid-response tool against emerging infectious threats. mRNA vaccines are also showing promise in targeting tough pathogens that traditional vaccines have struggled to tackle, such as cytomegalovirus. In addition to infectious diseases, mRNA vaccines are being explored for their potential in cancer treatment. Researchers are developing cancer vaccines that target multiple antigens on tumor cells simultaneously, making it harder for cancer cells to evade immune responses. mRNA therapies are also being tested to enhance the effects of existing cancer immunotherapies. Furthermore, mRNA has potential applications in genome editing, where it can be used to deliver instructions for making enzymes that can edit DNA. As researchers continue to improve the targeting and delivery of mRNA, it is expected to lead to the development of new drugs for various diseases.\n",

The envelope protein plays a crucial role in the formation of the virus envelope and has been linked to high levels of inflammation in severe cases of COVID-19. Variations in the tail end of the envelope protein, specifically the PDZ-binding motif (PBM), may allow the virus to interact more effectively with host proteins, making it more virulent.

      "Babies born during the COVID-19 pandemic have a different composition of gut microbes compared to those born before lockdowns were implemented. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in bodily function and development, and an imbalance can lead to various health issues. Studies have shown that being born during a lockdown can have a lasting effect on the microbiome, which can impact infants' development. Lockdown babies had lower diversity of microbes and distinct profiles compared to pre-pandemic babies. The lack of exposure to various environments and other children during lockdowns may explain these differences. The altered microbiome in lockdown babies has been linked to an increased risk of allergies and eczema. Research also suggests a potential link between the gut microbiome and impaired communication skills in infants born during lockdowns. However, more extensive and long-term studies are needed to fully understand the effects of lockdown on infant development.\n",

      "The combined effect of COVID-19 and climate change is hindering efforts to control malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa. COVID-19 containment measures may cause a spike in malaria deaths, similar to the West African Ebola epidemic. Studies have shown that malaria is expected to increase in the southern part of West Africa in the future. Heavy rainfall periods can trigger malaria epidemics, particularly in the southern area of West Africa. Climate variability is linked to malaria transmission in many West African countries. The region accounted for 96% of all malaria deaths in 2020, with disruptions in malaria prevention, diagnosis, and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic contributing to the increase. Climate change may lead to changes in vector species composition and behavior, rendering current interventions ineffective. There has been a reduction in funding for malaria control programs, and governments are urged to invest in increasing access to tools and healthcare workers for quick detection, diagnosis, and treatment. African governments are encouraged to take ownership of the fight against malaria.\n",

      "Immune cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 can trigger a massive inflammatory response that contributes to severe COVID-19, according to two recent studies. The studies implicate two types of white blood cells, macrophages in the lungs and monocytes in the blood, as the triggers for inflammation. The virus can infect and replicate in these immune cells, and evidence of such infections has been mixed until now. The findings suggest that infected immune cells could be a potential target for drug development. The studies also reveal that the virus can enter immune cells through the limited number of ACE2 receptors present, as well as through another surface protein called the Fcγ receptor with the help of antibodies. However, not all antibodies facilitate viral entry, and antibodies produced by people who received the mRNA vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech did not allow monocytes to take up the virus.\n",

      "A new study shows that even a mild case of COVID-19 can increase a person's risk of cardiovascular problems for at least a year after diagnosis. Rates of conditions such as heart failure and stroke were found to be substantially higher in people who had recovered from COVID-19 compared to those who hadn't had the disease. The risk was elevated even for those under 65 years of age and without risk factors such as obesity or diabetes. The study, based on a health-record database of veterans, found that people who had recovered from COVID-19 showed significant increases in 20 cardiovascular problems over the year after infection. The risk of stroke increased by 52% and the risk of heart failure increased by 72%. Hospitalization increased the likelihood of future cardiovascular complications, but even those who avoided hospitalization were at higher risk. The study highlights the need for healthcare providers to be prepared to address an increase in cardiovascular conditions following COVID-19.\n",

      "The COVID-19 vaccine is effective against severe disease for people who are underweight, overweight, or have obesity, according to a study published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology. The study also found that vaccinated people with underweight or overweight are at greater risk of hospitalization and death compared to vaccinated people of healthy weight. The study highlights the need for targeted efforts to increase vaccine uptake in people with a low BMI. Being vaccinated reduces the likelihood of hospitalization and death for all BMI groups, but the effect is slightly lower in underweight individuals. However, for all groups other than underweight people, being vaccinated significantly reduces the risk of hospitalization and death. The study suggests that the increased risk among people with obesity may be due to an altered immune response. Further research is needed to explore the relationship between BMI and immune responses.

The study found that a standard two-dose schedule with either the Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine generated a greater increase in antibodies when administered at a 12-week interval compared to a four-week interval. This immune response persisted for up to six months after the second dose. In mixed schedules, only Pfizer-BioNTech followed by Oxford-AstraZeneca showed a significantly stronger immune response at the 12-week interval. The study also found that T-cell responses decayed faster in the 12-week interval groups compared to the four-week interval groups. Extending the vaccination interval from four to 12 weeks reduced the likelihood of short-lived vaccine reactions by up to 80% in volunteers who received Pfizer-BioNTech as a second dose. Prophylactic paracetamol was found to be most effective in reducing reactogenicity in the group receiving Pfizer-BioNTech followed by Oxford-AstraZeneca. The study supports flexibility in priming intervals for all vaccine schedules, which can be beneficial in countries with inconsistent vaccine supply. The research provides important information for policymakers globally and may also be relevant for future vaccines against different diseases.

The majority of COVID-19 deaths since the beginning of 2023 are among the quadruple-vaccinated population. The unvaccinated population accounted for less than four figures in COVID-19 deaths, while the vaccinated population reached almost five figures, with the majority of deaths occurring among the quadruple-vaccinated. These statistics raise questions about the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines and the government's vaccination campaign.\n",

The UN has been building power for years through agreements like Agenda 2030 and has partnerships with globalist organizations. The pandemic has allowed the UN to gain control over passports, travel, banking, and the international economy. This power grab threatens individual privacy, national sovereignty, and the UN charter.

      "Retired American neurosurgeon Russell Blaylock recently gave an in-depth presentation on the adverse effects the spike proteins, induced by Covid-19 vaccination, have on the body. The doctor shared shocking discoveries about neurological damage, cancer rates, cardiac arrest, and other health issues. He explained that the spike protein causes microglial activation in the brain, leading to inflammation and cytotoxicity. The spike protein also alters neurological function, impairs memory, and increases reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Blaylock warned about the potential long-term effects on unborn children, including increased autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. He also discussed the mechanisms that cause cancer, such as activation of oncogenic viruses and elevated glutamate levels. Blaylock provided advice for those who have been vaccine-injured, including the use of certain compounds to quieten microglia and boost mitochondrial function. He also mentioned natural cancer treatments to raise lymphocytes and inhibit cancer growth.\n",

Data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) shows that from December 2020 to August 2022, there were 2,579 adverse events related to cancer reported after COVID-19 injections. In comparison, there were only 791 adverse events related to cancer reported for all other vaccines between 2008 and 2020. This means that there have been 40.3 times as many cancer cases related to COVID-19 vaccination than to flu vaccination. Furthermore, the number of cancer cases per 100,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered is 0.43, compared to just 0.0003 for flu vaccines. This means that COVID-19 vaccination is 1433.33 times more likely to cause cancer than flu vaccination. There is also scientific evidence that the COVID-19 mRNA injections can cause cancer of the ovaries, pancreas, and breast. The spike protein produced by the mRNA vaccines can damage the DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes, potentially leading to cancer. Cases of ovarian cancer have been increasing since the introduction of the COVID-19 injection.

      "Insurance industry executives are alarmed by the surge in deaths among young people, but they stop short of blaming the COVID-19 vaccine. Insurers are concerned about the rising mortality rates, especially among younger adults, which are significantly higher than historic norms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data show that mortality rates for Americans ages 15-45 rose 20-24% above normal in 2020 and increased even further in 2021. The concern is that even after the pandemic, mortality rates remain abnormally high among young people. Insurance companies are worried about the impact of these excess deaths on their assets and their ability to handle a sudden spike in claims. The Society of Actuaries (SOA) has conducted research on excess mortality rates during the pandemic and found no connection between historic death rates and COVID-19 vaccine mandates. However, some insurance executives and experts believe that the vaccines may be causing widespread, otherwise inexplicable, excess deaths. They point to evidence of vaccine-related injuries and deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and studies linking the vaccines to various health issues. Despite this, major media and government policy continue to dismiss the possibility of vaccine-induced excess deaths. The article concludes by highlighting the need for further investigation and a bipartisan effort to explore this issue and recommend a course of action.\n",

      "According to Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, only around 7-8% of the U.S. population has received the COVID-19 vaccine so far, which he attributes to \"Covid fatigue.\" To increase vaccine uptake, there is a push to combine COVID-19 and flu vaccines, although there are no safety studies on taking them together. The goal is to achieve higher vaccination rates by mandating the COVID-19 vaccine yearly. The flu vaccine uptake in the U.S. has been around 51-52% in recent years. Pfizer is moving into the final trial of a two-in-one flu and COVID-19 vaccine. However, there are concerns about the safety of taking both vaccines together, as studies suggest they may slightly increase the risk of strokes in older adults. The article also mentions several cases of adverse reactions and deaths following the administration of both COVID-19 and flu vaccines. The author criticizes the re-branding campaign to increase demand for these vaccines, calling them failed and toxic pharmaceutical products.\n",

This decision comes after data from the past two and a half years showed that COVID-19 vaccination reduces lifespan significantly and that over 9 in 10 COVID deaths are among the vaccinated. The ONS reports have revealed that COVID-19-vaccinated children are up to 52 times more likely to die than unvaccinated children. The reports also show that COVID-19 vaccination takes approximately five months to cause death. The data further indicates that the vaccinated population as a whole is more likely to die than the unvaccinated of any cause other than COVID-19. The trend continues across all age groups, with the most recent report revealing that quadruple vaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds are up to 318% more likely to die than unvaccinated individuals of the same age. The figures also show that the vaccinated accounted for 9 in every 10 COVID-19 deaths for the past two years. The UK Health Security Agency's data has shown that the COVID-19 injections had real-world effectiveness against infection of minus-109%. The latest report from the ONS reveals that 95% of COVID-19 deaths in England over a year were among the vaccinated, with 94% of those being among the quadruple vaccinated. The unvaccinated accounted for just 5% of COVID-19 deaths. These findings challenge the claimed effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines and highlight the devastating impact of vaccination on the population.\n",

Independent studies have confirmed the presence of Graphene Oxide in the vaccines, despite the denial from these sources. A document published by the FDA, ordered by a Federal Court, confirms that Graphene Oxide can end up in the vaccines due to the manufacturing process. Graphene Oxide has been shown to be toxic to cells and tissues in the body, causing oxidative stress and inflammation. There are concerns that Graphene Oxide may accumulate in certain organs or tissues over time. Additionally, a study conducted by Dr. Philippe Van Welbergen suggests that Graphene Oxide is being transmitted from the vaccinated to the unvaccinated, causing damage to red blood cells and blood clots. The deception surrounding the presence of Graphene Oxide in the vaccines has led to a crisis of trust in medical institutions and manufacturers.

He stated that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is contaminated with plasmid DNA, not just mRNA. He sequenced the DNA remnants from the vaccine vials and expressed concern about the potential consequences for human health and biology. He explained that the DNA could integrate into the genomic DNA of cells and cause rare but serious side effects, such as death from cardiac arrest. There is also a theoretical risk of future cancer. Prof. Buckhaults emphasized that DNA is long-lived and alterations to it can stick around. He discovered that there are many pieces of DNA in the Pfizer vaccine, and although they are small, they increase the risk of genome modification. His team determined that the DNA came from a plasmid that can be purchased online. Pfizer failed to remove the DNA before using it in the vaccine production process. Prof. Buckhaults estimated that there are about 200 billion pieces of plasmid DNA in each dose of the vaccine. He warned that the DNA is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles, which can deliver its contents into cells like a synthetic virus. He recommended testing vaccinated individuals to see if the plasmid DNA is integrating into their genomes. This could provide evidence of harm caused by the vaccine.\n",

The damage caused by each vaccine dose does not decrease over time and continues indefinitely. The Cleveland Clinic data shows that the more doses of the original vaccine an individual takes, the more likely they are to catch COVID. The original vaccine is not effective against the Omicron variant and actually weakens the immune system. Genetic vaccines also have negative effects on the cardiovascular, neurological, and reproductive systems. The data from New South Wales, Australia, reveals that those with one or two vaccine doses are 20 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital with COVID, while those with three or more doses are 35 times more likely.

      "A recent dataset released by the UK Government's Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveals a shocking pattern in mortality rates per 100,000 among teenagers and young adults. The analysis focused on individuals aged 18 to 39 in England from January to May 2023. The data showed that individuals who had received four doses of the COVID-19 vaccine had higher mortality rates compared to the unvaccinated. In every month, four-dose vaccinated individuals were significantly more likely to die than their unvaccinated counterparts. The mortality rate for the four-dose vaccinated reached a shocking 106 per 100,000 person-years in January, while the unvaccinated only reached a rate of 31.1. The average mortality rate per 100,000 person-years for the four-dose vaccinated was 94.58, making them 256% more likely to die than the unvaccinated. In February 2023, the mortality rate for the four-dose vaccinated was 318% higher than that of the unvaccinated.

The spike protein from the vaccines is causing heart injury in at least 2.8% of people who receive the COVID-19 injections.

Myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle cells, can occur when the spike protein binds to the blood vessels or muscle cells in the heart. Troponin levels, which indicate heart muscle cell damage, have revealed that many people post-COVID infection or vaccination have sustained subclinical degrees of myocardial inflammation. Elevated troponin levels raise concerns about long-term heart damage and the potential for acute worsening of heart function with additional spike protein exposures. An elevated D-dimer test indicates ongoing spike protein presence in the blood vessels, leading to blood clotting. Both the COVID-19 vaccine and infection have been documented to cause increased blood clotting. Elevated troponin and D-dimer levels should not be dismissed, and aggressive treatment is warranted.

      "Evidence has emerged that suggests Moderna, the pharmaceutical company behind the COVID-19 vaccine, actually created the COVID-19 virus. The evidence comes from a study that analyzed the genetic sequence of the virus and found a 19-nucleotide sequence patented by Moderna in the spike protein of COVID-19. This sequence is not found in any other natural virus. The study also found that the codon usage in the virus is not consistent with natural viruses, further supporting the idea that it was man-made. The article argues that Moderna created the virus in order to release it and profit from the sale of the vaccine. The author also mentions the role of other organizations, such as the NIH and NIAID, in the creation and cover-up of the virus.

      "Abnormal vaginal bleeding post COVID mRNA \"vaccine\" is a concerning issue that has not been well studied. There have been over 300,000 reports of abnormal vaginal bleeding or menstrual irregularities reported in WHO's VigiAccess, with heavy and prolonged bleeding being the most common. This issue is not limited to menstruating women, as non-menstruating women and even children as young as 5 to 11 years old have reported abnormal vaginal bleeding after receiving the COVID jab. Surveys show that COVID vaccines cause menstrual irregularities in a large percentage of women, ranging from 30% to 49%. Studies have found a potential link between the spike protein in the vaccines and changes in the endometrium, leading to inflammation and hormone level changes. It is unclear why these changes occur, but some believe it may be due to inflammation of the body's tissues, affecting the lining of the uterus. Studies have also found a significant relationship between the duration of flow, menstrual blood loss, and severity of dysmenorrhea before and after receiving the COVID vaccine. The European Medicines Agency has updated the product information of mRNA vaccines to include heavy menstrual bleeding as a potential side effect. It is important to further investigate the long-term consequences of abnormal uterine bleeding after COVID vaccination, especially in children and reproductive-age women.\n",

      "Graphene oxide, a poisonous substance, has been found in COVID-19 vaccines, water supply, air through chemtrails, and even in food supply. It interacts with electromagnetic frequencies (EMF), particularly those found in 5G, which can further harm health. Symptoms of graphene oxide poisoning and EMF radiation sickness are similar to those of COVID-19. However, there are ways to remove graphene oxide from the body and restore health. This can be done through a holistic approach, including specific supplements to degrade graphene oxide and controlling EMFs in the environment. Glutathione, a substance naturally produced by the liver, plays a crucial role in the immune system. When graphene oxide levels exceed glutathione levels, it can lead to immune system collapse and cytokine storm. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a supplement that helps the body produce glutathione. Zinc in combination with NAC can also degrade graphene oxide. Other supplements that can assist in the removal of graphene oxide include quercetin, vitamin C, and vitamin D. Graphene oxide is activated by EMF, particularly the frequencies in the 5G spectrum. To protect against graphene oxide poisoning, it is necessary to limit EMF exposure by avoiding living in areas with many towers, turning off Wi-Fi at night, and using EMF protection products. Orgone energy devices can help transform harmful EMF radiation into beneficial energy. The article also discusses conductive hydrogels, which contain graphene oxide and are used in various products, including COVID-19 injections, PCR test swabs, and masks. The effects of graphene oxide on blood cells are also explored, with orgone energy devices shown to preserve the life force and health of blood cells.

Official U.S. Government data confirms the risk of developing cancer following Covid-19 vaccination is 1433x greater than the background risk. A search of the CDC VAERS database reveals that from December 2020 up to August 2022, a total of 2,579 adverse events related to cancer were reported in just 1 year and 8 months. Comparatively, between 2008 and 2020, there were just 791 adverse events related to cancer reported for all other available vaccines. The number of adverse events related to cancer reported per 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine administered equates to 0.43 per 100,000 doses, making Covid-19 vaccination 1433x more likely to cause cancer than flu vaccination.

      "Pfizer mistakenly proves original COVID Vaccine destroys the Immune System after publishing Study for new Omicron Jab. According to Pfizer, the original Pfizer COVID injection destroys the immune system at a rate greater than 1% per day. The newly published study for Pfizer's new bivalent COVID vaccine proves that the old Covid-19 vaccine had a minus-44% negative efficacy after just 30 days. The study also shows that the destruction of the immune system is only going to get worse. The original Pfizer vaccine not only had no efficacy against Omicron, but it also progressively destroyed the immune system. Within 30 days of taking the Pfizer booster shot, individuals lost 44% of their first level immune response against the original Omicron variant. The vaccinated population has been shown to have higher infection rates compared to the unvaccinated for Omicron. Pfizer's figures for the new vaccine versus the old vaccine prove that the old vaccine did not work against Omicron. The old boosters were never vaccines, they were always anti-vaccines. Most Pfizer-vaccinated people now have Vaccine Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (VAIDS). The article also discusses the impact on individuals with compromised immune systems and the need for alternative treatments.

Some trace Patient Zero in China back to Dec. 8th, some to Nov. 17th; the virus was first present in France no later than Dec. 27th, based on the blood sample from a pneumonia patient; there is some evidence the virus was present in Italy as early as September and France as early as November; in May 2020, Cook County (Illinois) announces they will probe deaths involving pneumonia for indications of COVID-19 as far back as November, though at the time officially the first case in the USA goes back no further than January 21, 2020; In August 2021, health officials in Kansas claimed a patient died of COVID-19 on Jan. 9, 2020.\n",
      "According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the most widespread coronavirus to date, known as COVID-19, was discovered in Wuhan, China in November 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) subsequently declared it a global pandemic. The timeline of events leading up to the outbreak includes various incidents such as the release of a report in 2000 discussing the potential use of biological warfare, the anthrax attacks in 2001, and the lifting of a pause on gain-of-function research in 2017. In 2019, there were respiratory illnesses reported in Virginia and an unusually high number of respiratory-related outbreaks in the state. Additionally, members of the US delegation to the World Military Games in Wuhan fell ill with a respiratory sickness. The CDC also reported safety violations at the US Army Biolab at Ft. Detrick. In November 2019, the Pentagon's National Center for Medical Intelligence issued an alert about a contagion sweeping through Wuhan, a month before the Chinese identified the new coronavirus. The first cases of COVID-19 were officially announced in December 2019. The timeline also mentions controversies surrounding the identification of the first COVID-19 patient and the possibility of the virus being present in other countries prior to its official recognition.\n",

      "A panel of independent advisers to the CDC will meet next month to make recommendations on updated COVID-19 vaccines. The CDC's immunization panel is scheduled to vote on the vaccines at a Sept. 12 meeting. Vaccine makers such as Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax have created versions of their shots aimed at the XBB.1.5 subvariant of the virus. The subvariant, renamed \"Kraken,\" is estimated to have originated between November and December 2022 in or around New York state. The CDC has also detected a new SARS-CoV-2 variant labeled BA.2.86, which may be more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines. The CDC is continually monitoring for new variants and studying their potential impact on public health. US President Joe Biden plans to request additional funding from Congress to develop a new COVID-19 vaccine and it is likely that everyone will be encouraged to take the new shot. The CDC has discontinued its V-APP for VAERS pharmacovigilance program, which monitored adverse reaction reports, including fatal outcomes. The CDC's decision to discontinue the V-APP comes after an increase in COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths. The CDC has detected a new highly mutated lineage of the virus called BA.2.86, which raises concerns about the effectiveness of immunity from vaccines and previous infections. The CDC notes that it is too soon to know the real-world impacts on immunity and that more data is needed. The CDC believes that the antibodies from previous infections and vaccinations will provide some protection against the variant. However, the CDC's decision to discontinue the V-APP raises questions about the monitoring of adverse events related to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\n",

      "A study conducted by Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, has confirmed the high risk of strokes among vaccinated individuals who subsequently become infected with COVID-19. The study analyzed a statewide database of COVID-19 vaccine recipients in Georgia and found that those who contracted the virus within 21 days of vaccination had an increased risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. American cardiologist Peter McCullough commented on the study, stating that the COVID-19 vaccines load the body with the genetic code for the thrombogenic and lethal Wuhan Spike protein, making vaccinated individuals vulnerable to a catastrophe if they get infected with the virus. The research also highlighted the correlation between mRNA gene serums and serious neurocerebral pathologies. The conclusions of the Emory University study are further supported by research from the University Hospital of Tartu in Estonia, which found that vaccinated individuals have a greater risk of symptomatic infection and hospitalization from SARS-CoV-2. The article raises concerns about the rapid development and rollout of vaccines without sufficient data safety and monitoring, suggesting that many strokes could have been avoided if the vaccines were taken off the market earlier.\n",

      "A growing number of leprosy cases are being reported after COVID-19 vaccination, including two cases in the United Kingdom that researchers said may have been caused by the vaccines. The researchers examined records from the Leprosy Clinic at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in London. They found that of the 52 people who went to the clinic in 2021, at least 49 were vaccinated. The study definition of a leprosy adverse event associated with a COVID-19 vaccine included developing leprosy or a leprosy reaction within 12 weeks of receiving a dose and the person having no previous history of leprosy or a leprosy reaction. Two people met the case definition. One developed borderline tuberculoid (BT) leprosy one week after a second dose. The other experienced a reaction 56 days after a dose. Both doses were Pfizer’s BNT162b2 vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccines can provoke a response from white blood cells, or T cells. The cells are believed to protect against COVID-19. T-cells can theoretically trigger Mycobacterium leprae, a bacteria that causes leprosy, leading to leprosy or a leprosy reaction, the researchers said. Other vaccines have been shown to trigger leprosy or leprosy reactions, including tuberculosis vaccines, and some people who receive repeated COVID-19 vaccinations have been shown to have weakened immune systems. The person diagnosed with leprosy is an 80-year-old man who has lived in the United Kingdom for 49 years. He suffered from symptoms including thickened nerves. The leprosy diagnosis was confirmed via skin biopsy. The man may be the first to acquire leprosy in the UK since 1954. The man improved over time and actually received a third dose of Pfizer’s vaccine. The reaction was recorded in a 27-year-old man who had taken multidrug therapy, a drug for leprosy, in the past. He developed red plaques and thickened nerves before arriving in the UK from an unidentified country. A biopsy supported the diagnosis. Of the 52 people who went to the Leprosy Clinic for diagnosis and/or treatment in 2021, all but two reported their vaccination status. Of those 50, 49 were vaccinated. Five of the patients at the clinic were newly diagnosed with leprosy in 2021. Five others had a type one reaction. All were vaccinated, but just one of each category was determined to be possibly caused by a vaccine after being diagnosed within 12 weeks of vaccination. At least 14 other cases of leprosy or a leprosy reaction within 14 days of COVID-19 vaccination have been reported in the literature, including eight in India.

      "Scientists have discovered that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines contain dangerous spike DNAs that can reproduce toxic proteins in human cells for a long time. The research, conducted by Dr. Kevin McKernan and molecular biologist Jessica Rose, found that the contamination of mRNA vaccines with DNA is much greater than initially thought, with up to 35% of the vaccine product being DNA contamination. Each vaccine dose may contain trillions of DNA molecules, which can induce cells to produce the spike protein for an indefinite period of time. This could explain the persistence of spike protein in the blood of vaccinated individuals and the adverse effects of the vaccines. The level of DNA contamination in the Pfizer vaccine was found to be 10 times the \"safe\" level set by the European Medicines Agency. The discovery raises concerns about the safety of the vaccines and calls for further investigation and appropriate action by regulators.\n",

      "US scientists have found dangerous ingredients in mRNA vaccines that may cause long-COVID. The vaccines have shown an exponential rate of early infection following the first injection compared to placebo. The vaccines mimic viral envelopes with externalized phosphatidylserine (ePS), which can inadvertently facilitate the formation of pathological syncytia or fusion between immune cells. This can lead to the reoccurrence of COVID-19 symptoms in fully vaccinated individuals. The vaccines also use lipid nanoparticles and polyethylene glycol, which enable penetration into organs where spike protein triggers inflammation and immune system modulation. The vaccines may also activate HERV-W, an ancestral gene responsible for the merger of trophoblasts during early pregnancy, increasing clotting and bleeding risks in pregnant individuals. The study concludes that the vaccines were approved on an emergency basis without sufficient study of the viral antigen and fusion pathology. Residual COVID-19 symptoms could be caused by fusion pathology. The article also mentions the CDC recommending boosters every two months and the need to address other potential entry portals of the virus.\n",

      "The Ugly Bestiality of IsraelBy Dr. Elias Akleh The psychological concept of “projection” indicates the process when a person attributes (projects) one of his own personal psychotic characteristics onto another person or onto a group of people in order to justify his own psychotic behaviors towards others. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is a master “projector.” On October 7th. he had himself videotaped calling American president, Biden, with a smirk on his face while looking at the camera, claiming that Hamas, Palestinian freedom fighters, have attacked innocent Israeli citizens, raped young Israeli girls, and beheaded and burnt Israeli infants. These flagrant lies are repeated to justify the real murder, ribbing apart the body limbs of Palestinian infants, exploding infants’ heads, and burning their bodies by the American provided bombs Israeli fighter planes had dropped on the small 141 square miles enclave of the Gaza Strip. While Israel does not have any real documented evidence or pictures of claimed Palestinian atrocities against Israelis, history is full of official historical documents and video movies of Israeli atrocities against Palestinian civilians throughout the last 75 years of brutal occupation. Israel’s radicalism is clearly exhibited in the way they treat Palestinian hostages, detainees, and prisoners. Even dead and buried Palestinians were not spared from Israeli savagery and barbarity. Israelis have no respect to any non-Jewish form of life. This would be such a great “Christian” lesson particularly to Mike Pence, American former vice president, who is now touring Israel enjoying lunch and coffee with the Israeli terrorist soldiers on the Lebanese borders.\n",
      "The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been accused of projecting his own psychotic characteristics onto others in order to justify his own aggressive behaviors. He recently claimed that Hamas, Palestinian freedom fighters, have committed heinous acts against Israeli citizens, including rape and murder. These claims have been widely debunked, but they are used to justify the brutal attacks on the Gaza Strip by the Israeli military. Throughout history, there have been numerous documented cases of Israeli atrocities against Palestinian civilians, including massacres and sexual violence. Israel's treatment of Palestinian hostages, detainees, and prisoners is also marked by humiliation, torture, and even death. There have even been reports of Israeli military brigades desecrating Palestinian graveyards and extracting organs from corpses. The Israeli government's disregard for non-Jewish life is evident in their belief that non-Jews are meant to serve Jews. In contrast, Palestinians have shown compassion and humanity, sharing what little they have with each other and even caring for stray animals. The actions of Israeli officials, such as Mike Pence, who supports and praises Israeli soldiers, are a stark contrast to true Christian values. Dr. Elias Akleh, an Arab-American of Palestinian descent, has personal experience with the injustices inflicted upon Palestinians by Zionists.\n",

      "Florida State Surgeon General, Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo, has called for the immediate suspension of mRNA gene vaccines in the state. This comes after concerns were raised about the presence of nucleic acid contaminants and Simian Virus 40 (SV40) promoter/enhancer DNA in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. The presence of SV40 DNA may pose a unique and heightened risk of DNA integration into human cells, potentially leading to the transformation of healthy cells into cancerous cells. The FDA has been criticized for not conducting assessments on the risks of DNA integration in these vaccines. Dr. Ladapo emphasizes the importance of assessing these risks to protect human health and the integrity of the human genome. He urges providers to prioritize non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and treatment for patient health. Dr. Ladapo will continue to assess research surrounding these risks and provide updates to the public.\n",

The law authorized the use of the US Armed Forces against those responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The law gave Congress a blank check to push their agenda, which eventually led to the Department of Defense being in charge of a biowar against humanity. The main weapon in this war is the COVID-19 vaccines, which are being promoted as remedies for the virus. Public Law 107-40 was pushed without any investigation into the crime scene or possible culprits. This approach of taking action first and investigating later is becoming the new normal. The 9/11 attacks were used as a Trojan Horse to concentrate executive authority and sideline the rule of law. The events of 9/11 generated worldwide public hysteria and justified heightened police-state activity and military invasions. The government's transitions to a war-time footing after 9/11 were remarkable, including the invasion of Afghanistan, the release of the Patriot Act, and the transformation of citizens into terror suspects. The evidence suggests prior knowledge and preparation by the instigators of 9/11, similar to the organizers of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergency Measures enacted during the COVID-19 crisis have been absorbed into the governance of various institutions. The pharmaceutical industry claimed indemnifications under Emergency Use Authorizations. The ongoing cover-up of the 9/11 crimes has allowed powerful saboteurs to get away with world-transforming crimes.

The study found that individuals with concurrent COVID-19 infection had the strongest association with early ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke after receiving the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Specifically, the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was associated with a higher risk of early post-vaccination ischemic stroke compared to the BNT162b2 vaccine. The study also highlights the adverse reactions to experimental gene serums called COVID-breakthrough, where the pathogenic Spike protein of SARS-Cov-2 breaches the vaccine and triggers a highly symptomatic and sometimes lethal COVID-19 disease. The study concludes that COVID-19 infection leads to a much higher risk of stroke compared to the risk associated with the vaccine alone.

      "The US CDC has added COVID-19 vaccines to their childhood immunization schedule, including for 15-month-old children. These vaccines have only been tested on mice and adults, without proper clinical trials on children. Alarming research has shown that bivalent vaccines have more serious and frequent adverse reactions compared to monovalent vaccines. The CDC and FDA have also warned of risks of cerebral ischemia from the new Pfizer-Biontech boosters. The efficacy and safety of these vaccines have not been evaluated in immunocompromised individuals. There are concerns that the inclusion of these vaccines in the childhood immunization schedule could be linked to social and scholastic assistance for children, potentially creating a requirement for lower-income families to vaccinate their children in order to receive government aid benefits. This move also opens the door for local health departments and school districts to make these shots a requirement for school attendance. It is speculated that the FDA will fully approve these vaccines before the next school year starts, providing legal immunity for pharmaceutical companies.\n",

The survey also found that people who knew someone who experienced health problems after getting the vaccine were less likely to get vaccinated themselves. The survey data also suggests that side effects from the vaccine may be more common than previously thought, with 15% of respondents reporting a new health problem post-vaccination. The article also mentions other investigations that have found high rates of side effects and abnormal menstrual cycles in women who received the vaccine. The author criticizes the FDA and CDC for not conducting post-market surveys to assess the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.

The data shows a correlation between the rise in cancer and the public rollout of Covid mRNA shots. The U.S. federal government's own official data confirms that the risk of developing cancer following Covid vaccination increases by a staggering 143,233%. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database contains historical data on adverse reactions reported against every vaccine administered in the United States. Analysis of the VAERS data shows a dramatic spike in cancer cases among those vaccinated with the Covid shots. Comparing the number of cancer cases reported as adverse reactions to the Covid injections with other available vaccines reveals a significant difference. The number of adverse events related to cancer reported per 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine administered is 0.43, while for flu vaccines, it is just 0.0003. This means that Covid vaccination is 1433.33 times more likely to cause cancer than flu vaccination. Scientific evidence also suggests that the Covid mRNA injections can cause cancer of the ovaries, pancreas, and breast. The spike protein produced by the mRNA shots can damage the DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes, potentially leading to cancer. Additionally, patent documentation from Moderna, one of the manufacturers of Covid vaccines, shows that the shots contain DNA fragments linked to birth defects and cancer. The failure of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address this issue raises concerns, especially as several FDA officials secured jobs with Moderna after approving the shots. Dr. Robert Malone, one of the inventors of mRNA vaccine technology, highlighted these concerns during a recent hearing on Capitol Hill.

However, unvaccinated nurses, for example, were not granted exemptions and lost their positions.

The study found that ALS patients had an uneven distribution of a protein named YY1 in their cells, leading to a dysfunction in regulating another protein named Fuzzy. This imbalance could activate a pathway that contributes to the death of motor neurons. The researchers hope that targeting this signaling pathway could suppress the death of motor neurons and provide a new angle for developing therapeutics for ALS.

The study found that ALS patients had an uneven distribution of a protein named YY1 in their cells, leading to a dysfunction in regulating another protein named Fuzzy. This imbalance could activate a pathway that contributes to the death of motor neurons. The researchers hope that targeting this signaling pathway could suppress the death of motor neurons and provide a new angle for developing therapeutics for ALS. The study findings were published in the journal Nature Communications.\n",

      "People with natural immunity from recovering from COVID-19 are better protected against the virus compared to those who received a COVID-19 vaccine, according to a study conducted in Estonia. The study found that vaccinated individuals were nearly five times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 during the Delta variant era and 1.1 times more likely during the Omicron variant era, compared to those with natural immunity. Vaccinated individuals were also more likely to be admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 during both variant eras. The researchers concluded that natural immunity offers stronger and longer-lasting protection against infection, symptoms, and hospitalization compared to vaccine-induced immunity. The study also compared the protection of natural immunity to hybrid immunity (prior infection and vaccination) and found that hybrid immunity provided better protection against infection during the Delta era but had a slightly higher risk during the Omicron period. The study was funded by various organizations and the authors declared no competing interests.\n",

The study found that individuals who developed long COVID had previously received at least two doses of a COVID jab. The severity of a person's prior COVID infection was found to be a predictor of long COVID, with a higher incidence rate in those who had suffered a severe infection. People with pre-existing medical conditions were also found to be more prone to developing long COVID. The study also noted that individuals who received mRNA shots in a double-dose series were more likely to develop long COVID compared to those who received single-dose shots.

Gail Macrae, a nurse with Kaiser Permanente Santa Rosa, shared in an interview that huge numbers of people died from the treatment protocols that the CDC forced hospitals and doctors to adhere to. According to Macrae and an ICU doctor, approximately 90 percent of those who died were actually killed by the COVID-19 treatment protocols rather than the virus itself. Dr. Paul Marik, an experienced physician, also supported this estimate. Macrae explained that hospital record management systems marked all patients admitted with COVID-19 as \"unvaccinated\" by default, leading to the misconception that COVID-19 was a \"pandemic of the unvaccinated.\" She also mentioned high numbers of anaphylaxis reports following the first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as unusual symptoms and adverse events observed after the vaccine rollout. Macrae stated that some medical staff were warned that reporting vaccine side effects to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) would result in them being fired.\n",

      "According to bombshell testimony by pharmaceutical executive Alexandra “Sasha” Latypova, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were deliberately designed to be ineffective and lethal. Latypova claims that the Department of Defense (DoD) had a clear intent to harm and execute a mass genocide of Americans. The DoD oversaw the creation and rollout of the vaccines, and drug manufacturers like Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen were just obeying the DoD's orders. Latypova asserts that the shots were designed as a chemical and/or biological weapon against the people, with numerous mechanisms of injury built into them. She also states that the shots make people more likely to get sick and die, and that proper safety standards were ignored during their production.

Adjusting for factors such as vaccination status, the study determined that individuals who sometimes or often wore masks had a 33 percent higher incidence of COVID-19 compared to those who never or almost never wore masks.

A new study claims that extreme heat waves caused by climate change are linked to a surge in cardiovascular deaths, particularly affecting black and older people. The study suggests that deaths linked to extreme heat could triple by the middle of the century if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed. However, even if the US adopts extreme global warming measures, it would only reduce about 1,200 excess deaths per year, leaving 4,300 deaths due to weather-related heart problems. The researchers argue that individuals who are most vulnerable, except white people, should receive special treatment and tailored policy actions. The study found that the number of heart-related deaths rises in direct relation to the number of extreme heat days. However, the proportion of climate-related deaths is relatively small compared to overall cardiovascular deaths in the US. The article questions the validity of blaming extreme heat for the deaths and suggests that warm weather has always existed and the world is currently in a cooling phase.

      "The CDC has admitted that Covid-19 vaccinations reduce the lifespan of recipients by at least 24 years. Each mRNA vaccine dose increased mortality by 7% in 2022 compared to 2021. The more doses of the original vaccine a person took, the more likely they were to catch Covid. The original Covid vaccine is not effective against Omicron, but actually damages the immune system. Genetic vaccines have side effects on the cardiovascular, neurological, and reproductive systems. People are not recovering from the damage done by the shots in terms of excess mortality. Taking 2021 as the baseline, a person who received five doses of the vaccine would be 350% more likely to die in 2031 and 700% more likely to die in 2041 than an unvaccinated person. The life expectancy of a 30-year-old quintuply vaccinated person in the UK is 56 years, compared to an unvaccinated person who can expect another 50 years of life. The more shots a person takes, the weaker their immune system becomes. Vaccines are unsafe and extremely ineffective. The continuation of the pandemic is caused by the vaccines. In Australia, those with 1 or 2 doses are 20 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital with Covid than those with no doses, and those with 3 or 4 or more doses are 35 times more likely. The vaccines prevent herd immunity and put unsustainable pressure on hospitals and ICUs. The double vaccinated are 20 times more likely to catch the latest variant, and the triple vaccinated are 35 times more likely. The Australian government is now going to stop classifying hospital data by vaccination status. The data analyzed only address the disease the vaccines are supposed to protect against and do not address the side effects. The credibility and viability of all healthcare worldwide depend on the immediate cessation of genetic vaccination.\n",

A new preprint study conducted by scientists with the FDA and three large healthcare companies revealed this concerning finding. The study shows that seizures \"met the statistical threshold for a signal\" in children aged 2 to 4 following a single dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The same safety signal was also detected among children aged 2 to 5 following receipt of a Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. The researchers noted that there are reports of seizures and convulsions after COVID-19 vaccination among children in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Another five convulsions were reported after Pfizer vaccination in the pharmaceutical giant's own clinical trial. The researchers said the signal \"should be interpreted with caution and further investigated in a more robust epidemiological study.\" In addition to seizures, the study also detected a signal for heart inflammation and related conditions in children aged 12 to 17. The study has strengths in terms of the large and geographically diverse population covered by the databases, but limitations include a lack of control of confounding factors.\n",

Via the ADEPT program, DARPA was an early investor in Moderna's mRNA therapeutics & vaccines. The company announced today their experimental coronavirus vaccine, built in part on this groundbreaking work, is nearly 95% effective at preventing illness. The acronym ADEPT stands for Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics. Introducing foreign nucleic acids, RNA or DNA, into the body to generate foreign proteins is, by definition, gene therapy, regardless of whether or not the subject's own genes are changed by it. Cationic lipids, like the lipid nanoparticles used in mRNA vaccines, are capable of transfecting basically any type of cell with instructions to make proteins. There has been a major push for the adoption of nucleic acid vaccine tech in prior years, largely hidden from the public eye. The military would be interested in this technology for quickly vaccinating large populations of people against bioweapons ahead of pandemic spread. DARPA openly bragged on Twitter that Moderna's mRNA vaccine technology, and by extension Moderna's Covid vaccine, was a product of ADEPT. A review of dozens of patent applications found that Moderna received approximately $20 million from the federal government in grants several years ago, and the funds \"likely\" led to the creation of its vaccine technology. Corporate media, with few exceptions, are largely silent on this matter. The reason you have been kept in the dark is because you are the target of a globe-spanning military operation, with population reduction, mass surveillance, tyrannical control of people's movements, and the destruction of human autonomy through implanted technology as its end goal.\n",

The report warns that the COVID-19 vaccines were never approved under the traditional approval process for drugs in Canada and that the necessity to establish their safety and efficacy appears to have been set aside. Canada's Food and Drug Regulations legally require any drug slated for approval to have undergone proper safety and effectiveness testing, but the COVID jabs were exempted from this process due to the \"emergency.\" Canada ultimately approved the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen, and AstraZeneca COVID jabs using a subjective test, meaning bureaucrats simply decided that the benefits outweighed the risks. The Interim Order process used in Canada to approve the shots prevented these authorizations from ever being revoked, even if evidence later showed they were dangerous. Dr. Peter McCullough supports the NCI report and concludes that all COVID-19 vaccines are unsafe for human use and must be removed from the Canadian market immediately.\n",

The Nipah virus has a mortality rate between 40-70%, while COVID-19 has a mortality rate of 2-3%. Gavi, the vaccine alliance, has suggested that Nipah could be the next pandemic and the development of drugs and vaccines for the disease is becoming increasingly urgent. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged a five-year, US$1.6 billion commitment to deliver vaccines to the world's poorest countries. In response to the recent outbreak in Kerala, India, restrictions have been tightened, including the closure of educational institutions, parks, and beaches, as well as the ban on prayer gatherings and public events.

      "According to a new evidence review from the Royal Society, lockdowns, face masks, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions were effective in reducing Covid-19 transmission. The report found that lockdowns had a reduction in the rate of spread of the virus by about 50%. However, the report did not address the potential harms of these interventions. The lack of higher quality studies on the effectiveness and safety of lockdowns and mask mandates was also criticized. The report concludes that when implemented together, these interventions can provide powerful and prolonged reductions in viral transmission. However, the effectiveness of face masks in particular has been questioned, with previous studies suggesting that they do not significantly reduce viral transmission.

The company's role in alleviating the worst of the pandemic has meant it has become a victim of its own success, as demand for its COVID products dwindles along with serious cases of the virus. Shares are down 31 percent this year to date, a loss of more than $88 billion in market capitalization. Pfizer itself has endured similar sales drops in the past for Viagra and its anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor. The New York-based drugmaker cut back slower-growing businesses that provided steady cash flow prior to the pandemic, instead betting on higher-growth but more volatile prescription drugs. It paid off handsomely during the pandemic as Pfizer sold billions of the COVID-19 shots it developed alongside Germany's BioNTech. Company shares reached a record high of around $61 in December 2021 at the height of the Omicron variant. But it has since come crashing down to earth, with its shares now worth around $35.\n",

Of the 2,000 people surveyed, taller people were more likely to be diagnosed with Covid-19.

Blood issues also increased significantly after the vaccine rollout. The mainstream media and health authorities have remained silent on this issue. The corporate-controlled media is reluctant to report on the spike in disabilities and blood issues, and the information is being ignored and covered up by the powers that be. The pharmaceutical industry is particularly resistant to reporting these truths. Critics argue that the push for COVID-19 vaccines aligns with the goals of Agenda 21 and that society is being forced to accept dangerous and ineffective jabs.\n",

      "A senior Pentagon official has confirmed that cases of myocarditis soared among US service members in 2021 after the COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ were rolled out. According to Gilbert Cisneros Jr., undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, there were 275 cases of myocarditis in 2022, a 151 percent spike from the annual average from 2016 to 2020. The COVID-19 vaccines can cause myocarditis, a form of heart inflammation that can lead to mortality, including sudden death. COVID-19 also can cause myocarditis. In 2021, the rate of myocarditis was higher among those with prior infection compared to those who had been vaccinated. Some papers have found that COVID-19 vaccines increase the risk of myocarditis.\n",

Gilbert Cisneros Jr., undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, revealed that there were 275 cases of myocarditis in 2022, a 151 percent rise compared to the average from 2016 to 2020. Myocarditis is a form of heart inflammation that can lead to mortality, including sudden death, and can be caused by both COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccines. Data from the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database showed that the rate of myocarditis was higher among individuals with prior infection compared to those who had been vaccinated. Some studies have also indicated that COVID-19 vaccines increase the risk of myocarditis. However, it is unclear how the military accounted for service members who had a prior COVID-19 infection and received a COVID-19 vaccination.\n",

      "A Big Pharma scientist has revealed that both Pfizer and Moderna put known cancer-causing agents into their Covid injections. Microbiologist Kevin McKernan discovered dangerous levels of double-stranded DNA plasmids in the vaccines. DNA contamination is a huge problem as it can invade human cells, replicate antibiotic-resistant genes, and cause sepsis and cancer. The World Council for Health stated that DNA contamination poses a risk to everyone on the planet and called for an immediate stop to the Covid-19 vaccine program. McKernan also found Simian Virus 40 (SV40) promoters in Pfizer's mRNA injection, which are tied to cancer development in humans. SV40 was found in the polio vaccine and a federal law was passed in 1961 to prevent its inclusion in vaccines. McKernan warns that there is no quality control in the manufacturing process of these vaccines, which could lead to anaphylaxis, blood clotting, antibiotic resistance, gene integration risk, and long-term production of spike protein within the body. Japanese Professor Murakami expressed concerns over the presence of SV40 promoters in Pfizer's vaccine, stating that it is a well-known carcinogenic virus sequence that is unnecessary for producing the mRNA vaccine.\n",

      "The BBC's Trusted News Initiative has been found guilty of contributing to the excess deaths of two million people due to its censorship of the dangers of the mRNA COVID vaccines. The initiative is a partnership with mainstream media outlets and fact checkers aimed at suppressing dissent on social media and censoring views that oppose the mainstream narrative. The Ministry of Truth, which includes powerful institutions such as the BBC, UN, and World Economic Forum, established strict standards and guidelines for news organizations to follow, resulting in severe consequences for those who published information not approved by these institutions. Scientists and experts were also brought under the Ministry's purview, leading to the silencing of research and findings that didn't align with the government's narrative on COVID-19. This censorship and suppression of dissenting voices led to a society where people were afraid to speak out, governments had too much control over information, and important and potentially life-saving information was withheld. The article presents figures showing excess deaths in various countries following the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, contradicting the official narrative that the vaccine is safe and effective. The author argues that the vaccine is the main cause of these excess deaths. The article concludes by emphasizing the ongoing dangers of censorship and the importance of protecting freedom of speech and individual rights.\n",

However, the study was removed by the journal after only 24 hours, stating that the study's conclusions were not supported by the methodology. The study aimed to investigate possible causal links between Covid-19 vaccine administration and death using autopsies and post-mortem analysis. The most implicated organ system in Covid-19 vaccine-associated death was the cardiovascular system, followed by the hematological system, the respiratory system, and multiple organ systems. The mean time from vaccination to death was 14.3 days, with most deaths occurring within a week from the last vaccine administration. A total of 240 deaths were independently adjudicated as directly due to or significantly contributed to by Covid-19 vaccination.

Dr. Denis Rancourt, PhD, a top physics expert, warns that the number of deaths is expected to rise sharply in the coming years. He has studied data from countries around the world and found that at least 13 million people died as a result of complications from the experimental vaccine. In India alone, the Covid vaccination campaign resulted in the deaths of 3.7 million people. Dr. Rancourt argues that Covid cannot be responsible for the spike in deaths as claimed by governments and health agencies, citing a strong correlation to poverty and no correlation with age. He also points out that during the Covid period, all Western countries cut antibiotics prescriptions by 50 percent, which means they were not treating bacterial pneumonia. Dr. Rancourt further explains that the age structure of excess mortality has changed during the vaccination period and that the peaks occur in specific hotspots around the world, suggesting that a virus was not responsible for the increases in mortality. He reveals that injecting elderly people, who were already at a high risk of dying due to a deteriorating immune system, drove up the death numbers exponentially throughout the pandemic.\n",
