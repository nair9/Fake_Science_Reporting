The study aimed to analyze the clinical presentation, hospitalization rates, and antibody titers against the spike antigen in vaccinated individuals who tested positive for the virus.\\n\\nThe study collected samples from vaccinated individuals who reported breakthrough infections at various healthcare facilities in Odisha. Out of the 274 samples analyzed, more than 83.2% of the individuals showed symptoms, with 9.9% requiring hospitalization. Interestingly, the seropositivity rate was significantly higher in Covishield recipients (96.7%) compared to Covaxin recipients (77.1%). Additionally, hospitalized patients had lower median antibody titers compared to individuals in home isolation.\\n\\nThe median age for breakthrough infections was 47.0 years, with Covishield recipients being significantly older. The median spike receptor binding domain IgG titer values were 213.5 AU/ml for Covaxin recipients and 647.5 AU/ml for Covishield recipients. These findings emphasize the importance of systematic data capture to monitor the emergence of vaccine escape variants and inform future vaccine development strategies.',\n",
