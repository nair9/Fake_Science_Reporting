    "# A newly discovered virus in Russian bats, called Khosta-2, shares similarities with SARS-CoV-2 and has the potential to infect humans. The spike proteins of Khosta-2 can infect human cells and are resistant to current vaccines. This finding emphasizes the need for universal vaccines that can protect against all sarbecoviruses, rather than just specific variants of SARS-CoV-2. While most sarbecoviruses cannot infect human cells, Khosta-2 poses a potential threat. The virus can attach to a receptor protein found in human cells using its spike protein, and current vaccines do not neutralize it. Although Khosta-2 lacks certain genes involved in human pathogenesis, there is a risk of it combining with other viruses to create a potentially more dangerous virus.\n",
    "# OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine how Americans’ opinions of the seriousness of various health-related problems have changed over time and to quantify the public’s preferences for research prioritization. METHODS: We conducted a survey that asked respondents to rate the seriousness of 80 health-related problems on a 4-point Likert scale (“very serious problem,” “somewhat serious problem,” “not too serious of a problem,” or “not a problem at all”). Results were compared with past surveys from 2001 and 2013 that examined the same set of health-related problems (with the exception of COVID-19). The survey also included best-worst scaling questions that asked respondents to select, from 20 health problems, those they considered most and least important for research funding. Respondents were recruited from the KnowledgePanel, a nationally representative sample of American households. RESULTS: A total of 768 adults completed the survey between September 3, 2020, and September 14, 2020. The health-related problems that Americans consider to be “very serious” generally align with the leading causes of death and noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and mental health; nevertheless, several social determinants of health are also identified. COVID-19 was an unsurprising top priority, whereas cancer remains the highest and a persistent priority for research funding. CONCLUSIONS: Americans consider a diverse set of health-related problems to be “very serious,” with recognition of social determinants of health rising. Our findings offer guidance as to the disease areas for which the public would value further public and private investment in treatment innovations.COVID 19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a newly discovered coronavirus, has caused the global pandemic of early 2020 The first case was described in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and by March 2020, most countries around the world have put in place some of the strictest restrictions seen in decades in order to slow down the spread of the disease Patients with preexisting hypertension and cardiovascular comorbidities were reported to be at an increased risk of serious infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 Considering that those are among the most common chronic medical conditions in the Western world, the potential impact of it is huge The proposed mechanism behind those associations is the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE II) in those patients Furthermore, the association between ACE inhibitors/AR blockers, which are among the most frequently prescribed medications, and serious cases of COVID 19 has been studied with the same mechanism in mind The reports on the association between hypertension and COVID 19 morbidity and mortality are less clear, and the International Society of Hypertension even claims that there is none The reports on the association between heart failure or coronary disease and COVID 19 are more uniform, and all seem to point to a greater risk from serious infections faced by patients with those comorbidities A significant effort will need to be invested by the scientific community into finding strategies for protecting those patients from contracting the virus in the first place and then, once infected, into developing management plans aimed at preserving cardiac function as much as possibleCOVID-19 has caused immense social and economic losses throughout the world. Subjects recovered from COVID are learned to have complications. Some studies have shown a change in the heart rate variability (HRV) in COVID-recovered subjects compared to the healthy ones. This change indicates an increased risk of heart problems among the survivors of moderate-to-severe COVID. Hence, this study is aimed at finding HRV features that get altered in COVID-recovered subjects compared to healthy subjects. Data of COVID-recovered and healthy subjects were collected from two hospitals in Delhi, India. Seven ML models have been built to classify healthy versus COVID-recovered subjects. The best-performing model was further analyzed to explore the ranking of altered heart features in COVID-recovered subjects via AI interpretability. Ranking of these features can indicate cardiovascular health status to doctors, who can provide support to the COVID-recovered subjects for timely safeguard from heart disorders. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study with an in-depth analysis of the heart status of COVID-recovered subjects via ECG analysis. © 2021 IEEE."

Twenty-three percent of the sequences represented unique recombinant forms (URFs), whereof 37 (11%) could be grouped into seven potentially novel CRFs. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis suggested that five major Nigerian HIV-1 sub-epidemics were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, close to the Nigerian Civil War. The analysis also indicated that the number of effective infections decreased in Nigeria after the introduction of free antiretroviral treatment in 2006. Finally, Bayesian phylogeographic analysis suggested gravity-like dynamics in which virus lineages first emerge and expand within large urban centers such as Abuja and Lagos, before migrating towards smaller rural areas. This study provides novel insight into the Nigerian HIV-1 epidemic and may have implications for future HIV-1 prevention strategies in Nigeria and other severely affected countries.The present study aims to investigate the genomic variability and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan along with its role in the spread and severity of infection during the three waves of COVID-19. A total of 453 genomic sequences of Pakistani SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from GISAID and subjected to MAFFT-based alignment and QC check which resulted in removal of 53 samples. The remaining 400 samples were subjected to Pangolin-based genomic lineage identification. And to infer our SARS-CoV-2 time-scaled and divergence phylogenetic trees, 3804 selected global reference sequences plus 400 Pakistani samples were used for the Nextstrain analysis with Wuhan/Hu-1/2019, as reference genome. Finally, maximum likelihood based phylogenetic tree was built by using the Nextstrain and coverage map was created by employing Nextclade. By using the amino acid substitutions, the maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were developed for each wave, separately. Our results reveal the circulation of 29 lineages, belonging to following seven clades G, GH, GR, GRY, L, O, and S in the three waves. From first wave, 16 genomic lineages of SARS-CoV-2 were identified with B.1(24.7%), B.1.36(18.8%), and B.1.471(18.8%) as the most prevalent lineages respectively. The second wave data showed 18 lineages, 10 of which were overlapping with the first wave suggesting that those variants could not be contained during the first wave. In this wave, a new lineage, AE.4, was reported from Pakistan for the very first time in the world. However, B.1.36 (17.8%), B.1.36.31 (11.9%), B.1.1.7 (8.5%), and B.1.1.1 (5.9%) were the major lineages in second wave. Third wave data showed the presence of nine lineages with Alpha/B.1.1.7 (72.7%), Beta/B.1.351 (12.99%), and Delta/B.1.617.2 (10.39%) as the most predominant variants. It is suggested that these VOCs should be contained at the earliest in order to prevent any devastating outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the country.The present study aims to investigate the genomic variability and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan along with their role in the spread and severity of infection during the three waves of COVID-19.

    "The mechanistic involvement of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) reaches beyond cardiovascular physiopathology. Recent knowledge pinpoints a pleiotropic role for this system, particularly in the lung, and mainly through locally regulated alternative molecules and secondary pathways. Angiotensin peptides play a role in cell proliferation, immunoinflammatory response, hypoxia and angiogenesis, which are critical biological processes in lung cancer. This manuscript reviews the literature supporting a role for the renin-angiotensin system in the lung tumor microenvironment and discusses whether blockade of this pathway in clinical settings may serve as an adjuvant therapy in lung cancer.SIMPLE SUMMARY: Glioblastoma (GB) is the most aggressive brain cancer in humans. Patient survival outcomes have remained dismal despite intensive research over the past 50 years, with a median overall survival of only 14.6 months. We highlight the critical role of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) on GB cancer stem cells and the tumor microenvironment which, in turn, influences cancer stem cells in driving tumorigenesis and treatment resistance. We present recent developments and underscore the need for further research into the GB tumor microenvironment. We discuss the novel therapeutic targeting of the RAS using existing commonly available medications and utilizing model systems to further this critical investigation. ABSTRACT: Glioblastoma (GB) is an aggressive primary brain tumor. Despite intensive research over the past 50 years, little advance has been made to improve the poor outcome, with an overall median survival of 14.6 months following standard treatment. Local recurrence is inevitable due to the quiescent cancer stem cells (CSCs) in GB that co-express stemness-associated markers and components of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). The dynamic and heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a fundamental role in tumor development, progression, invasiveness, and therapy resistance. There is increasing evidence showing the critical role of the RAS in the TME influencing CSCs via its upstream and downstream pathways. Drugs that alter the hallmarks of cancer by modulating the RAS present a potential new therapeutic alternative or adjunct to conventional treatment of GB. Cerebral and GB organoids may offer a cost-effective method for evaluating the efficacy of RAS-modulating drugs on GB. We review the nexus between the GB TME, CSC niche, and the RAS, and propose re-purposed RAS-modulating drugs as a potential therapeutic alternative or adjunct to current standard therapy for GB.BACKGROUND The Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) comprises a complex molecular cascade with two counter-regulatory axes, the classical and the alternative. Angiotensin II and Angiotensin-(1-7), the main peptides of the RAS, exert opposite effects in multiple organs and systems, including the cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary and immune systems. Strong evidence supports the hypothesis of a local RAS in the Central Nervous System (CNS) and its modulatory roles in neuroendocrinology and neurotransmission. OBJECTIVE In this narrative review, we provide a comprehensive approach on experimental and clinical data regarding RAS molecules expression and possible roles in physiology and physiopathology of CNS diseases. METHODS This non-systematic review summarizes evidence on RAS implications in CNS diseases and its possible relationships with COVID-19. RESULTS We divided the possible RAS mechanisms in distinct conditions during lifespan, approaching from congenital infections to neurodegenerative alterations, passing through mood disorders and cerebrovascular diseases. We also gathered current evidence about the possible effects of RAS in Covid-19, particularly the described cases that course with neurological manifestations. CONCLUSION Although there are limitations and controversies, the analysis of RAS mechanisms in the CNS certainly represents an interesting field of research. However, further investigation is necessary to support the noteworthy interactions and provide a better comprehension of the cross-talk between RAS and the CNS. Investigations in this research field may shed lights to novel therapeutic targets.\n",
