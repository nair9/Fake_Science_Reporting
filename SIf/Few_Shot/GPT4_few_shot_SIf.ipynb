    "A groundbreaking study has revealed that the 2014 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo was the result of a clandestine government experiment that went awry, rather than natural human-to-human transmission. The research, published in a reputable scientific journal, indicates that the government was covertly testing a biological weapon named \"Ebola-X,\" engineered to be exceptionally contagious and lethal. This experiment inadvertently triggered the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, affecting the DRC\\'s population. The findings of the study have sparked significant concerns regarding the government\\'s role in the outbreak and the actual intentions behind the experiment.\n",

    "The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) experienced a confined rural outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) with 69 reported cases from July to October 2014. Understanding the transmission dynamics during the outbreak can provide important information for anticipating and controlling future EVD epidemics. I fitted an EVD transmission model to previously published data of this outbreak and estimated the basic reproduction number R(0) = 5.2 (95% CI [4.0–6.7]). The model suggests that the net reproduction number R(t) fell below unity 28 days (95% CI [25–34] days) after the onset of symptoms in the index case. This study adds to previous epidemiological descriptions of the 2014 EVD outbreak in DRC, and is consistent with the notion that a rapid implementation of control interventions helped reduce further spread.BACKGROUND: As of February 25, 2019, 875 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, Democratic Republic of Congo. Since the beginning of October 2018, the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed conflict has occurred, and in which EVD cases and their contacts have been difficult for health workers to reach. We used available data on the current outbreak, with case-count time series from prior outbreaks, to project the short-term and long-term course of the outbreak. METHODS: For short- and long-term projections, we modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process that assumes gradually quenching transmission rates estimated from past EVD outbreaks, with outbreak trajectories conditioned on agreement with the course of the current outbreak, and with multiple levels of vaccination coverage. We used two regression models to estimate similar projection periods. Short- and long-term projections were estimated using negative binomial autoregression and Theil-Sen regression, respectively. We also used Gott’s rule to estimate a baseline minimum-information projection. We then constructed an ensemble of forecasts to be compared and recorded for future evaluation against final outcomes. From August 20, 2018 to February 25, 2019, short-term model projections were validated against known case counts. RESULTS: During validation of short-term projections, from one week to four weeks, we found models consistently scored higher on shorter-term forecasts. Based on case counts as of February 25, the stochastic model projected a median case count of 933 cases by February 18 (95% prediction interval: 872–1054) and 955 cases by March 4 (95% prediction interval: 874–1105), while the auto-regression model projects median case counts of 889 (95% prediction interval: 876–933) and 898 (95% prediction interval: 877–983) cases for those dates, respectively. Projected median final counts range from 953 to 1,749. Although the outbreak is already larger than all past Ebola outbreaks other than the 2013–2016 outbreak of over 26,000 cases, our models do not project that it is likely to grow to that scale. The stochastic model estimates that vaccination coverage in this outbreak is lower than reported in its trial setting in Sierra Leone. CONCLUSIONS: Our projections are concentrated in a range up to about 300 cases beyond those already reported. While a catastrophic outbreak is not projected, it is not ruled out, and prevention and vigilance are warranted. Prospective validation of our models in real time allowed us to generate more accurate short-term forecasts, and this process may prove useful for future real-time short-term forecasting. We estimate that transmission rates are higher than would be seen under target levels of 62% coverage due to contact tracing and vaccination, and this model estimate may offer a surrogate indicator for the outbreak response challenges.As of May 27, 2018, 6 suspected, 13 probable and 35 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) had been reported in Équateur Province, Democratic Republic of Congo. We used reported case counts and time series from prior outbreaks to estimate the total outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use. We modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process model that included reproduction numbers from past Ebola outbreaks and a particle filtering method to generate a probabilistic projection of the outbreak size and duration conditioned on its reported trajectory to date; modeled using high (62%), low (44%), and zero (0%) estimates of vaccination coverage (after deployment). Additionally, we used the time series for 18 prior Ebola outbreaks from 1976 to 2016 to parameterize the Thiel-Sen regression model predicting the outbreak size from the number of observed cases from April 4 to May 27. We used these techniques on probable and confirmed case counts with and without inclusion of suspected cases. Probabilistic projections were scored against the actual outbreak size of 54 EVD cases, using a log-likelihood score. With the stochastic model, using high, low, and zero estimates of vaccination coverage, the median outbreak sizes for probable and confirmed cases were 82 cases (95% prediction interval [PI]: 55, 156), 104 cases (95% PI: 58, 271), and 213 cases (95% PI: 64, 1450), respectively. With the Thiel-Sen regression model, the median outbreak size was estimated to be 65.0 probable and confirmed cases (95% PI: 48.8, 119.7). Among our three mathematical models, the stochastic model with suspected cases and high vaccine coverage predicted total outbreak sizes closest to the true outcome. Relatively simple mathematical models updated in real time may inform outbreak response teams with projections of total outbreak size and duration.\n",

The research explored three geocoding techniques, revealing that 72.9% of individuals could be pinpointed within 250 meters of their actual residences. Additionally, participatory mapping proved even more precise, with 82.0% of compounds correctly identified within a 2x2.5 km area plus a 500-meter buffer zone. These findings underscore the potential of geolocation tools in enhancing disease surveillance and control in rural settings.\n",

Geocoding was able to locate 72·9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 67·7–77·6] of individuals to within 250 m of the true compound location. The participatory mapping exercise was able to correctly locate 82·0% of compounds (95% CI 78·9–84·8) to a 2 × 2·5 km area with a 500 m buffer. The self-reported nearest landmark was able to locate 78·1% (95% CI 73·8–82·1) of compounds to the correct catchment area. These strategies tested provide options for quickly obtaining spatial information on individuals presenting at health facilities.Background: Adequate hand hygiene practices throughout the continuum of care of maternal and newborn health are essential for infection prevention. However, the hand hygiene compliance of facility-based birth attendants, parents and other caregivers along this continuum is low and behavioural-science informed interventions targeting the range of caregivers in both the healthcare facility and home environments are scarce. We assessed the limited efficacy of a novel multimodal behaviour change intervention, delivered at the facility, to improve the hand hygiene practices among midwives and caregivers during childbirth through the return to the home environment. Methods The 6-month intervention was implemented in 4 of 8 purposively selected facilities and included environmental restructuring, hand hygiene infrastructure provision, cues and reminders, and participatory training. In this controlled before-and-after study, the hand hygiene practices of all caregivers present along the care continuum of 99 women and newborns were directly observed. Direct observations took place during three time periods;labour, delivery and immediate aftercare in the facility delivery room, postnatal care in the facility ward and in the home environment within the first 48hrs following discharge. Multilevel logistic regression models, adjusted for baseline measures, assessed differences in hand hygiene practices between intervention and control facilities. Results The intervention was associated with increased odds of improved practice of birth attendants during birth and newborn care in the delivery room (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4.7;95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.7, 7.7), and that of parental and non-parental caregivers prior to newborn care in the post-natal care ward (AOR = 9.2;CI = 1.3, 66.2);however, the absolute magnitude of improvements was limited. Intervention effects were not presented for the home environment due COVID-19 related restrictions on observation duration at endline which resulted in too low observation numbers to warrant testing. Conclusion Our results suggest the potential of a facility-based multimodal behaviour change intervention to improve hand hygiene practices that are critical to maternal and neonatal infection along the continuum of care.Background: Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had broad consequences on health outcomes with significant morbidity and mortality. Rural health systems face more challenges in the availability of a workforce, adequate infrastructure and equipment. We completed a baseline assessment of the health system in Siaya at the beginning stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and designed an integrated intervention to maximize the prevention of COVID-19 cases and optimize case management at community and health facility levels. Methods: In partnership with the Ministry of Health (MOH), we trained health care workers in COVID-19 infection prevention, control, and case management at community and health facility levels. We strengthened the diagnostic and monitoring capacity of healthcare workers with thermometers and pulse oximeters, and we trained clinicians in basic critical care. In addition, we addressed leadership skills and psychological first aid. Youth were included during implementation to promote the uptake of digital tools by health care workers. Primary outcome measures were the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in Siaya. Secondary outcome measures were related to hand hygiene practices and use of essential health services;specifically, the incidence of diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections not related to COVID-19, and the number of facility based deliveries. Findings: The incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases was low compared to neighboring counties (with risk reduction ratios up to 7.8, CI 6.85-8.89). The total number of COVID-19 cases was 266 and the total number of COVID-19 related deaths was 7 at the time of the analysis in November 2020. The incidences of diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections (URTIs) not related to COVID-19 were lower in 2020 compared to 2019 and use of essential maternal health services was maintained during the COVID-19 response: specifically, the mean number of diarrheal cases was 3’033 in 2020 and 4’795 in 2019 (p=0.001);the mean number of URTIs not related to COVID-19 was 19’683 in 2020 and 27’567 in 2019 (p=0.015);and the mean number of facility based deliveries was 2’402 in 2020 and 2’322 in 2019 (p=0.2). Interpretation: An integrated and comprehensive intervention with capacity building at community and health facility levels results in the reduction of COVID-19 infections, and the reduction in the number of diarrheal and non COVID-19 related respiratory infections. Furthermore, the intervention resulted in the maintained use of maternal health services during the COVID-19 response.Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04501458Funding Statement: Wellcome TrustDeclaration of Interests: None to declare.Ethics Approval Statement: Ethical review approvals received from the University of Nairobi Ethics Review Committee and Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital Ethics Review Committee (approval number IERC/JOOTR/219/20)\n",
