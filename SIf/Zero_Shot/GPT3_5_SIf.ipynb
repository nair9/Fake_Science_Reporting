      "Nigeria has the highest number of AIDS-related deaths in the world. In this study, we characterised the HIV-1 molecular epidemiology by analysing 1442 HIV-1 pol sequences collected 1999â€“2014 from four geopolitical zones in Nigeria using state-of-the-art maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. The main circulating forms were the circulating recombinant form (CRF) 02_AG (44% of the analysed sequences), CRF43_02G (16%), and subtype G (8%). Twenty-three percent of the sequences represented unique recombinant forms (URFs), whereof 37 (11%) could be grouped into seven potentially novel CRFs. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis suggested that five major Nigerian HIV-1 sub-epidemics were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, close to the Nigerian Civil War. The analysis also indicated that the number of effective infections decreased in Nigeria after the introduction of free antiretroviral treatment in 2006. Finally, Bayesian phylogeographic analysis suggested gravity-like dynamics in which virus lineages first emerge and expand within large urban centers such as Abuja and Lagos, before migrating towards smaller rural areas. This study provides novel insight into the Nigerian HIV-1 epidemic and may have implications for future HIV-1 prevention strategies in Nigeria and other severely affected countries.The present study aims to investigate the genomic variability and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan along with its role in the spread and severity of infection during the three waves of COVID-19. A total of 453 genomic sequences of Pakistani SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from GISAID and subjected to MAFFT-based alignment and QC check which resulted in removal of 53 samples. The remaining 400 samples were subjected to Pangolin-based genomic lineage identification. And to infer our SARS-CoV-2 time-scaled and divergence phylogenetic trees, 3804 selected global reference sequences plus 400 Pakistani samples were used for the Nextstrain analysis with Wuhan/Hu-1/2019, as reference genome. Finally, maximum likelihood based phylogenetic tree was built by using the Nextstrain and coverage map was created by employing Nextclade. By using the amino acid substitutions, the maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were developed for each wave, separately. Our results reveal the circulation of 29 lineages, belonging to following seven clades G, GH, GR, GRY, L, O, and S in the three waves. From first wave, 16 genomic lineages of SARS-CoV-2 were identified with B.1(24.7%), B.1.36(18.8%), and B.1.471(18.8%) as the most prevalent lineages respectively. The second wave data showed 18 lineages, 10 of which were overlapping with the first wave suggesting that those variants could not be contained during the first wave. In this wave, a new lineage, AE.4, was reported from Pakistan for the very first time in the world. However, B.1.36 (17.8%), B.1.36.31 (11.9%), B.1.1.7 (8.5%), and B.1.1.1 (5.9%) were the major lineages in second wave. Third wave data showed the presence of nine lineages with Alpha/B.1.1.7 (72.7%), Beta/B.1.351 (12.99%), and Delta/B.1.617.2 (10.39%) as the most predominant variants. It is suggested that these VOCs should be contained at the earliest in order to prevent any devastating outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the country.The present study aims to investigate the genomic variability and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan along with their role in the spread and severity of infection during the three waves of COVID-19.
