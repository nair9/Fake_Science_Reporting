He explained that the spike protein can cause unusual clumping in the bloodstream, which is not typical for a protein to cause clotting without other necessary factors. Dr. Resia Pretorius from South Africa also found that the spike protein can cause proteins to clump together when platelets are removed from the blood. Dr. Cole warned that the spike protein in the mRNA vaccines is toxic and can lead to adverse health outcomes in the short term and for future generations. He mentioned that the vaccines have caused a significant increase in the rate of myocarditis and a decline in fertility in rats. Dr. Cole also observed that placentas from vaccinated individuals contain spike proteins and are not properly sized for the age of gestation, showing signs of calcification, inflammation, and antibodies. Whistleblower Naomi Wolf reported that the placentas of vaccinated mothers are shrunken and have a silver-gray color, indicating that they are not sufficient to sustain a normal baby. Additionally, retired neurosurgeon Dr. Russell Blaylock explained that the spike proteins induced by the mRNA vaccines can cause neurological damage by affecting the neurological apparatus of the brain and spinal cord, leading to inflammation and activation of the immune system.

Additionally, data from Portugal, the most vaccinated nation in Europe, shows that the number of deaths is similar to previous years when no one was vaccinated. A comparison of outcomes within nations also reveals that countries like Japan and Australia experienced meaningful numbers of deaths after the mass vaccination campaigns, while Africa largely escaped excess deaths throughout 2021-2022. The study further explains that the immune response generated by the Pfizer shots switches from neutralizing antibodies to non-neutralizing antibodies over time, which may contribute to the increased risk of reinfection and the presence of long COVID symptoms.

The decision comes as Covid cases continue to decline and officials need to review current recommendations. The UK's medical chiefs previously ruled that under-30s should be offered Pfizer or Moderna's vaccine due to rare blood clots associated with AstraZeneca's shot. However, health bosses maintain that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe for almost everyone and that the risk of complications is minimal. The decision to offer alternatives was made because the benefits of the vaccine are not as clear-cut for younger adults who face a low risk of dying from Covid. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is currently reviewing the situation and will make a decision on whether to offer alternatives to the under-40s. Professor Anthony Harnden, who sits on the jab advisory panel, warned that delaying the immunisation program could lead to increased infection rates and more deaths and hospitalizations. The meeting tomorrow will also discuss expanding the vaccine rollout to thirty-somethings in the coming weeks. Another top medic, Sir Munir Pirmohamed, stated that women face no greater risk of blood clots from the AstraZeneca vaccine than men. The UK's drug regulator, the MHRA, has been closely monitoring cases of blood clots associated with the vaccine, with 168 cases reported so far out of millions of doses administered. The clots are believed to occur when the vaccine triggers an immune response that attacks platelets, leading to clot formation. Several EU countries have restricted the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for certain age groups, and the same condition has been observed in recipients of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in the US.\": [0.6666666666666666,\n",

The researchers found that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath of patients with Omicron differed from those with Delta and earlier variants, suggesting that VOCs could be used to distinguish between COVID-19, its variants, and non-COVID illnesses.

The study's senior author, Vicente Planelles, believes that this finding could eventually lead to new treatments for long COVID. Previous research had suggested that elevated levels of cytokines, which are involved in inflammation, were driving long COVID, but the Utah study found the opposite result, with diminished or nonexistent activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines in individuals with long COVID. The researchers theorize that this drop in cytokine activity occurs because the immune cells responsible for producing them become exhausted during COVID-19 infection.

While there were 75,000 fewer deaths in 2021 than in 2020, there were more years of life lost to COVID-19. This is because the median age at which people died from the illness dropped by nearly a decade, resulting in individuals missing out on potential years of life.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) impacts lipid metabolism in the body, which has implications for COVID-19 infection and mRNA vaccination. The interaction between the S protein and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) may contribute to adverse effects observed in some individuals following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Deuterated lipids were used to understand the effect of lipid saturation on the ability of the S protein to hijack lipid metabolism during infection. The S protein has a stronger ability to remove cholesterol and polyunsaturated lipids compared to saturated and monounsaturated lipids. The study showed that the S protein changes HDL function depending on the lipid serum profile of a person. This interaction between the S protein and HDL may contribute to adverse effects observed in some individuals following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.': [0.4,\n",

       " {\"New research from Emory University suggests that COVID-19 can trigger temporary autoimmunity in some patients. The study found that during severe COVID-19 infections, the immune system generates a wide variety of autoantibodies that attack the body's own tissues. However, after the infection subsides, these autoantibodies decay and are mostly removed from the body. In some cases, levels of certain types of autoantibodies remain elevated for months after the initial infection, particularly in patients with long COVID. The researchers suggest that testing for autoantibodies during acute infection could help identify patients who may need early intervention. Additionally, therapies that deplete autoantibody activity may improve long-term recovery outcomes. The study also found high levels of autoantibodies in hospitalized patients with bacterial pneumonia, indicating that autoimmunity can be triggered in other settings of intense inflammation. Further research is needed to understand the role of autoantibodies in persistent symptoms of long COVID.\": [0.4,\n",

The study found that those with long COVID and neurological symptoms had abnormal brain activity during memory tests on functional MRI scans. These individuals showed less activity in certain brain regions used for memory tasks but more activity in other areas of the brain. While the study does not prove that COVID caused these brain changes, there appears to be a strong association between the changes and lingering neuropsychiatric symptoms. Long COVID affects an estimated 30% of individuals who had COVID-19 infections, with cognitive and psychiatric symptoms being among the most prevalent. The study recommends neurorehabilitation or psychiatric treatments for these patients.

The research found that individuals with severe disease had elevated levels of a fungus that can activate the immune system and induce long-lasting changes. This suggests that antifungal treatment could potentially provide relief to critically ill COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 can alter the microbial composition of the gut, allowing pathogens to enter the bloodstream. Some severely ill COVID-19 patients have also developed dangerous fungal infections in their lungs. The study examined blood and fecal samples from COVID-19 patients and found higher levels of gut fungi, particularly Candida species, in individuals with severe disease. The presence of certain fungal species, such as Candida albicans, has been shown to activate the immune system and trigger inflammation. The study also found that individuals with severe COVID-19 had elevated levels of antibodies against C. albicans, which were linked to the number of immune cells associated with inflammation. When mice were infected with C. albicans from severe COVID-19 patients and then exposed to SARS-CoV-2, more immune cells invaded their lungs and triggered inflammation compared to mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 alone. Treatment with an antifungal drug reduced the number and activity of these immune cells. The study also revealed that individuals with severe COVID-19 continued to have elevated levels of antibodies against C. albicans and immune cells primed to counter fungi even after recovering from the disease, suggesting a potential link between mycobiota changes during COVID-19 and inflammation associated with long COVID. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between gut fungi and COVID-19, including whether the observed changes in mycobiota are a result of the disease or a predisposing factor.
