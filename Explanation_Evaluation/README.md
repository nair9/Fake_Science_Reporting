## Explainability Analysis
To assess the explainability of the proposed architectures, the LLM was prompted to not only classify news articles as reliable or unreliable but also to provide explanations for its classifications. The response from the LLM showcases its capability to analyze the content of news articles alongside their supporting evidence and articulate the distinctions, making the explanations comprehensible for users. This capability is crucial as it aids in evaluating the accuracy of the model's prediction.
