In today's world, how people understand and use science affects many aspects of daily life. A clear example of this is the COVID-19 pandemic, where accurate information about vaccinations was often twisted to sway public opinion and behavior. This highlights the urgent need for effective ways to identify and combat misinformation, especially when it appears to be scientifically credible.

Detecting misinformation that sounds scientific is still a new and complex field. Current technology has a hard time accurately spotting and flagging misleading information, especially when it comes from sources that seem trustworthy or use complex language. This challenge is even greater when misinformation is mixed with real information across various platforms.

To tackle these challenges, we need innovative approaches. One effective strategy is to avoid making new claims and instead summarize articles to clearly and accurately convey their main points. This method helps provide clarity without adding potentially misleading information. Another approach uses large language models (LLMs) that are specifically trained to generate claims. These models can be fine-tuned to detect and highlight misinformation, making them powerful tools in the fight against false scientific information.

By improving these methods, we can better detect and reduce the impact of misinformation that sounds scientific. This will help create a more informed and resilient public.
